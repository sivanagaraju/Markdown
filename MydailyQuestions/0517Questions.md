## What Is the Use of Pydantic AI?

If you already use Pydantic for data validation in FastAPI or SQLAlchemy, you know how Pydantic models help ensure your data is structured and correct. **Pydantic AI** builds on these strengths, but focuses on making it easier to build applications that use generative AI (like LLMs) in a reliable, production-ready way.

### In Simple Terms

- **Pydantic AI lets you define what kind of data you expect from an AI model (like ChatGPT) using Pydantic models, just as you would for API requests or database schemas.**
- It acts as a bridge between your Python code and the AI model, making sure the inputs and outputs are always validated and structured.

### Key Uses for a Python Developer

- **Type-safe AI Outputs:** You define the structure of the AI’s response with Pydantic models. The AI is prompted to return data in that exact structure, and Pydantic validates it-just like with API schemas. If the AI returns something wrong, it can automatically ask the AI to try again[1][4][5].
- **Function Calling:** You can define Python functions (tools) that the AI agent can call. The arguments and results are validated with Pydantic, ensuring the AI uses your functions correctly[1][6].
- **Agent Framework:** Pydantic AI provides an “agent” abstraction. The agent manages the conversation with the AI, uses your tools, handles retries on validation errors, and guarantees that the final output matches your Pydantic model[1][4][6].
- **Production-Ready:** It includes features like dependency injection, monitoring, and cost tracking-making it easier to use AI in real-world, scalable apps[5][6].
- **Model Agnostic:** You can use it with different LLMs (OpenAI, local models, etc.) without changing your code structure[5][7].

### Example

Suppose you want to build an AI assistant that answers questions and returns the answer, a confidence score, and sources. You define:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class AgentResponse(BaseModel):
    answer: str = Field(..., description="Response to the user's query")
    confidence: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1)
    sources: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

Pydantic AI will:
- Tell the LLM to return data in this format.
- Validate the LLM’s output.
- If the output doesn’t match, it asks the LLM to fix it automatically[1][4][5].

### Why Use It?

- **Consistency:** Guarantees that your AI outputs are always structured and valid.
- **Safety:** Catches errors early, just like with API validation.
- **Simplicity:** Uses the same Pydantic models and patterns you already know from FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.
- **Extensibility:** Makes it easy to add new tools, prompts, or models as your app grows[4][6][7].

**In summary:**  
Pydantic AI brings the reliability and structure of Pydantic data validation to AI-powered applications, letting you use LLMs as safely and predictably as you use APIs or databases[1][4][5][6].

## Key Differences Between LangChain v0.3 and v0.2

LangChain v0.3 introduces several notable changes and improvements over v0.2, with a primary focus on internal dependencies, modularity, and developer experience. Below is a detailed comparison:

| Feature/Change                | LangChain v0.2                  | LangChain v0.3                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Pydantic Version (Python)** | Pydantic v1                      | Migrated to Pydantic v2 (breaking change). Pydantic v1 is no longer supported[1][2][3][4][5]. |
| **Python Version Support**    | Python 3.8+                      | Python 3.8 support ends October 2024. Requires Python 3.9+[2][3]. |
| **Integrations**              | Many integrations bundled or in `langchain-community` | More integrations moved to standalone `langchain-x` packages for better dependency management. Legacy implementations deprecated but still available for now[1][3]. |
| **Tool Definition**           | Previous, more complex approach  | Simplified tool definition and usage[1][2][3]. |
| **Chat Model Utilities**      | Limited utilities                | Added universal model constructor, rate limiter, message utilities (trimming, filtering, merging)[1][2][3]. |
| **Callbacks (JS)**            | Blocking by default              | Non-blocking/backgrounded by default; must `await` to ensure completion[2][3]. |
| **Deprecated Features**       | Legacy chains, document loaders, and entry points still present | Deprecated many legacy chains and entry points; migration guides provided. Deprecated Google PaLM in favor of new packages[1][2][3]. |
| **Documentation**             | Previous documentation           | Revamped and expanded integration docs and API reference[1][3][5]. |
| **Community Contributions**   | Ongoing                         | Highlighted, with more visible collaborative improvements[5]. |
| **Performance & Stability**   | Existing                         | Improved performance and bug fixes[5]. |

### Python-Specific Changes

- The migration from Pydantic v1 to v2 is the main breaking change. All user code and custom models should update to use Pydantic 2 features (e.g., replace `validator` with `field_validator`)[1][2][3][4].
- Python 3.8 is no longer supported after October 2024[2][3].

### JavaScript-Specific Changes

- All LangChain packages now require `@langchain/core` as a peer dependency instead of a direct dependency, requiring explicit installation to avoid type errors[2][3].
- Deprecated and removed several old entry points in favor of new, modular packages[2][3].

### Other Improvements

- Modularization: More integrations have been split into their own packages, making dependency management and updates easier[1][3].
- Custom Events: New ability to dispatch custom events across both Python and JavaScript[1][2][3].
- Enhanced documentation for easier migration and onboarding[1][3][5].

## Summary

LangChain v0.3 is primarily a maintenance and modernization release, with the most significant change being the internal migration to Pydantic v2 for Python, resulting in some breaking changes for users who relied on Pydantic v1 features. The release also brings improved modularity, better documentation, and enhanced utilities for chat models and tool definitions. For JavaScript, dependency management has been improved by moving to peer dependencies. While the functional additions are incremental, the structural and dependency changes are substantial and require attention when upgrading[1][2][3][5].

Pydantic is a modern Python library for data parsing and validation that leverages Python’s type hints to enforce constraints, serialize/deserialize data, and integrate seamlessly with frameworks like FastAPI and ORMs like SQLAlchemy. By defining data schemas as classes inheriting from `BaseModel`, Pydantic reduces boilerplate, catches errors early (even at IDE time), and offers high performance through optional C optimizations. Below, we’ll explore its background, core features, benefits for senior developers, integration points, and walk through a step‑by‑step example to cement your understanding.

## Background

Pydantic was created to solve Python’s lack of built‑in data validation by using standard type annotations to define and enforce data schemas at runtime ([Pydantic][1]). It has quickly become the most widely adopted validation library in the Python ecosystem, underpinning tools such as FastAPI ([Real Python][2]).

## Core Concepts & Features

1. **BaseModel Inheritance**: Define models by subclassing `pydantic.BaseModel` and annotating fields with standard types (e.g., `str`, `int`, `datetime`) ([PyPI][3]).
2. **Automatic Type Coercion & Validation**: Input data is coerced (e.g., strings to numbers or dates) and validated against type hints; validation errors raise a `ValidationError` with clear messages ([GeeksforGeeks][4]).
3. **Serialization & Parsing**: Models provide `.dict()`, `.json()`, and class methods like `model.parse_obj()` to effortlessly convert between native Python objects and JSON/dicts ([BetterStack][5]).
4. **Custom Validators**: Use the `@field_validator` decorator (v2+) or `@validator` (v1) to run pre‑ or post‑processing logic on fields for complex checks ([Medium][6]).
5. **Settings Management**: With `pydantic-settings`, you can load configuration from environment variables, `.env` files, and more, ideal for 12‑factor apps ([Real Python][2]).
6. **Performance**: Optimized in pure Python, with optional Cython speedups for even faster validation under heavy loads ([GeeksforGeeks][4]).

## Benefits for Senior Developers

* **Less Boilerplate**: Replace manual `if not isinstance(...)` checks with concise, declarative models ([Reddit][7]).
* **IDE/Type‑Checker Integration**: Linters and IDEs instantly recognize your schemas, catching mismatches before runtime ([Pydantic][1]).
* **Consistent Error Handling**: Centralized `ValidationError` objects make it easy to format and log errors uniformly across your codebase ([Pydantic][8]).
* **Seamless Framework Support**: FastAPI uses Pydantic under the hood to parse request bodies, query params, and generate OpenAPI docs automatically ([Real Python][2]).

## Integration Examples

* **FastAPI**: Declare request and response models directly in endpoint signatures; FastAPI parses and validates JSON inputs without extra code ([Real Python][2]).
* **SQLAlchemy**: Combine SQLAlchemy models with Pydantic schemas for clean separation of data layers—use Pydantic for I/O and SQLAlchemy for persistence, mapping fields between them with `pydantic.from_orm` ([GeeksforGeeks][4]).

## Step‑by‑Step Example

```python
from datetime import date
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator, ValidationError

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    signup_ts: date

    # Custom validator: ensure name is title‑cased
    @field_validator('name', mode='before')
    def title_name(cls, v):
        return v.title()

# 1. Correct data parses and validates
user = User(id='123', name='alice', signup_ts='2025-05-17')
print(user.dict())
# → {'id': 123, 'name': 'Alice', 'signup_ts': date(2025, 5, 17)}

# 2. Invalid data raises errors
try:
    User(id='abc', name=456, signup_ts='not-a-date')
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e.json())
```

1. We pass strings for `id` and `signup_ts`; Pydantic coerces them to `int` and `date` ([GeeksforGeeks][4]).
2. The custom validator title‑cases `name` before assignment ([Medium][6]).
3. Providing impossible conversions (e.g., `id='abc'`) results in a structured `ValidationError` detailing each field failure ([Pydantic][8]).

## How to Remember Pydantic

* **BaseModel = schema**
* **Type hints = rules**
* **Construct = validate + parse**
* **`.dict()`/`.json()` = serialize**
* **`@field_validator` = custom logic**

By thinking in these simple mappings, you’ll quickly recall Pydantic’s core workflow in any Python application.

------

Yes, as a **senior Python developer**—especially if you're using **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, or building APIs, data pipelines, or backend services—knowing **Pydantic beyond the basics** is very beneficial. Let's go deeper into what **else you should know**, grouped by **real-world usage** and **best practices**.

---

## 🔁 1. Advanced Field Features

### a. **Field Aliases**

Useful when external data uses different field names than your Python model.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class User(BaseModel):
    user_id: int = Field(..., alias="userId")

user = User(userId=123)
print(user.user_id)  # 123
```

> ✅ Great for working with JSON APIs that use camelCase naming.

---

### b. **Default Factories**

If you want dynamic defaults (e.g., timestamps):

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from datetime import datetime

class Log(BaseModel):
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
```

---

## 🧠 2. Validators (Single & Cross-field)

### a. **Single Field Validator**

Like `.strip()`, `.lower()`, etc.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator

class User(BaseModel):
    email: str

    @field_validator('email')
    def normalize_email(cls, v):
        return v.strip().lower()
```

---

### b. **Cross-field Validation**

When validation depends on multiple fields.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, model_validator

class Booking(BaseModel):
    start_date: str
    end_date: str

    @model_validator(mode='after')
    def check_dates(self):
        if self.end_date < self.start_date:
            raise ValueError("end_date must be after start_date")
        return self
```

---

## ⚙️ 3. Model Configuration (ModelConfig or `Config` in v1)

You can control behaviors like:

* Allowing extra fields
* Aliases
* ORM compatibility

```python
class User(BaseModel):
    name: str

    class Config:
        extra = "forbid"  # Raises error on unknown fields
```

---

## 📤 4. `.parse_obj()`, `.model_dump()`, `.model_json()`

### Useful for:

* Converting between dicts/JSON and models
* Dumping sanitized data
* Logging

```python
data = {'name': 'Alice'}
u = User.model_validate(data)         # Pydantic v2 way
print(u.model_dump())                 # Similar to .dict() in v1
```

---

## 🔗 5. Pydantic + SQLAlchemy (with `from_orm`)

```python
class SQLUser(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

class UserSchema(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True

user = SQLUser(id=1, name="Alice")
schema = UserSchema.from_orm(user)
```

> 💡 Enables clean separation between DB layer and API/data layer.

---

## 🌿 6. Settings & Environment Variables (`pydantic-settings`)

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    db_url: str
    debug: bool = False

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

settings = Settings()
```

> 💡 Best practice for config-driven apps or microservices.

---

## 🚨 7. Error Handling Best Practices

Structured and consistent error handling is easy:

```python
try:
    user = User(**some_data)
except ValidationError as e:
    return {"error": e.errors()}  # List of field-wise error dicts
```

---

## 🔬 8. Performance Tips

* **Avoid re-creating models unnecessarily** in hot loops
* **Use compiled Pydantic** (optional dependency `pydantic-core` or `ujson`)
* **Use `construct()`** for creating models *without validation* (use with caution)

```python
u = User.construct(name="Unsafe", id=123)  # skips validation
```

---

## ✅ Summary: Why Go Deeper with Pydantic?

| Feature/Use Case                  | Why it Matters                     |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

Sure! Here's a simple explanation of each of these files used in a Python project:

---

### 1. **`pyproject.toml`**

* **What it is:** A modern configuration file for Python projects.
* **Purpose:** Defines build system tools and project metadata in a single place.
* **Commonly used by:** Tools like **Poetry**, **Flit**, or **Black**.
* **Contains:**

  * Project name, version, authors
  * Dependencies (what your project needs to run)
  * Build system info (e.g., Poetry or setuptools)

📦 Think of it like a “master project file” that tells tools how to build and manage your Python project.

---

### 2. **`setup.cfg`**

* **What it is:** An older-style configuration file for Python packaging.
* **Purpose:** Works with `setup.py` to define metadata and settings.
* **Used by:** **setuptools**
* **Contains:**

  * Name, version, description
  * Entry points
  * Dependencies

🧾 It's more structured than `setup.py` (uses a config file instead of Python code), but it's slowly being replaced by `pyproject.toml`.

---

### 3. **`poetry.lock`**

* **What it is:** A lock file generated by **Poetry**.
* **Purpose:** Locks the exact versions of dependencies used in the project.
* **Why it's important:** Ensures everyone who installs your project gets the same versions of libraries.

🔒 Think of it like a recipe with exact ingredient brands and amounts — no surprises, everything works the same for everyone.

---

### Summary

| File             | Purpose                                      | Used by                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `pyproject.toml` | Main config for dependencies and build tools | Poetry, Black, Flit, etc. |
| `setup.cfg`      | Metadata and packaging config (older)        | setuptools                |
| `poetry.lock`    | Exact versions of all dependencies           | Poetry                    |

Let me know if you want an example of each!

The `uv` package in Python is a **next-generation, ultra-fast package manager**, developed by **Astral (the makers of Ruff)**. It’s written in **Rust** and is designed to be a **drop-in replacement for pip**, but much faster.

---

### ✅ **Key Features of `uv`**

* **Very fast** (much faster than pip)
* Handles **dependency resolution** and **environment management**
* Compatible with `pyproject.toml` (like Poetry)
* Can act like `pip`, `pip-compile`, and `virtualenv` — all in one tool

---

### 📦 **What Can `uv` Do?**

* Install dependencies (`uv pip install`)
* Sync dependencies from a lock file (`uv pip sync`)
* Resolve and lock dependencies (`uv pip compile`)
* Manage virtual environments (`uv venv`)

---

### 🚀 **How to Install `uv`**

You can install `uv` using pipx or pip:

```bash
pip install uv
# OR (recommended way)
pipx install uv
```

---

### 🔧 **Common Commands and How to Use**

#### 1. **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
uv venv
```

This creates a `.venv/` folder just like `python -m venv`.

---

#### 2. **Activate the virtual environment**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

---

#### 3. **Install a package**

```bash
uv pip install requests
```

This works just like `pip install`, but faster.

---

#### 4. **Freeze and create a lock file**

```bash
uv pip compile
```

This resolves and writes the exact dependency versions to a lock file.

---

#### 5. **Install all dependencies from lock file**

```bash
uv pip sync
```

This ensures all packages are installed exactly as listed in the lock file.

---

### 📁 Project Structure with `uv` and `pyproject.toml`

If you use `uv` with a `pyproject.toml` file, it understands dependencies defined there, similar to Poetry:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
dependencies = [
    "requests",
    "pandas"
]
```

Then run:

```bash
uv pip install
```

---

### 🧠 Summary

| Tool             | Role                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `uv pip install` | Fast install of dependencies |
| `uv pip sync`    | Syncs env to match lock file |
| `uv pip compile` | Creates lock file            |
| `uv venv`        | Creates virtual environments |

---

Would you like a sample project structure using `uv` and `pyproject.toml`?


Here’s a **sample project structure** using `uv` and `pyproject.toml`, with a step-by-step explanation.

---

### 📁 **Sample Project Structure**

```
my-awesome-project/
├── pyproject.toml
├── uv.lock              # Created after `uv pip compile`
├── .venv/               # Virtual environment (created by `uv venv`)
└── main.py
```

---

### 📜 **1. `pyproject.toml` Example**

```toml
[project]
name = "my-awesome-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A demo project using uv"
authors = ["Your Name <your@email.com>"]
dependencies = [
  "requests",
  "pandas"
]
requires-python = ">=3.8"
```

> This file tells `uv` (and other tools) what your project needs to run.

---

### 🐍 **2. Create Virtual Environment with `uv`**

```bash
uv venv
```

* This creates a `.venv/` folder in your project.

Activate it:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

---

### 📦 **3. Install Dependencies**

```bash
uv pip install
```

* This installs `requests` and `pandas` as specified in `pyproject.toml`.

---

### 🔒 **4. Lock Dependencies**

```bash
uv pip compile
```

* This generates a `uv.lock` file — **like `poetry.lock`**, it contains exact versions for reproducible builds.

---

### 🔁 **5. Sync Environment on Another Machine**

When you clone this project somewhere else:

```bash
uv venv         # Create virtual environment
uv pip sync     # Install packages from lock file (exact versions)
```

---

### 🧪 **6. Sample Python File (`main.py`)**

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
data = response.json()

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df.head())
```

---

### ✅ Summary of Commands

```bash
uv venv                 # Create virtual environment
uv pip install          # Install dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv pip compile          # Create uv.lock
uv pip sync             # Install exactly what's in uv.lock
```

Here’s a concise rundown of the major parsing approaches you can plug into your RAG ingestion pipeline and how **Docling** and **LlamaParse/LlamaCloud** fit into the picture:

Both Docling and LlamaCloud’s LlamaParse can handle PDFs, Excel, Word, PPTX, HTML, images, etc., but **Docling** is a fully local, open‑source Python library you can embed in any environment, while **LlamaParse** today runs as part of the managed **LlamaCloud** service (private‑beta / enterprise) and requires calling a cloud API rather than purely local execution.

---

## Parsing Techniques for RAG Ingestion

### 1. Traditional, Rule‑Based & OCR‑Aided Parsers

* **PDFMiner**, **PyMuPDF** or **Apache Tika** extract text and basic layout via heuristics and regex – you can run these entirely on‑premises but they struggle with complex layouts and tables. ([Medium][1])
* **Tesseract OCR**, **Amazon Textract**, **Google Vision API** add OCR for scanned docs, but often involve cloud calls (except Tesseract, which is local). ([Towards AI][2])

### 2. Hybrid ML/Computer‑Vision Parsers

* Tools like **LayoutParser** or **Camelot** use ML models to detect tables, figures, and reading order locally, improving on text‑only approaches. ([arXiv][3])

### 3. LLM‑Augmented & Deep‑Model Parsers

* **Docling** employs specialized AI models (DocLayNet for layout, TableFormer for tables) to produce a rich JSON/Markdown document representation, all running locally with PyTorch. ([arXiv][4], [GitHub][5])
* **LlamaParse** (part of **LlamaCloud**) is a GenAI‑native parser that handles complex, nested layouts and multi‑modal content—but parsing happens via LlamaCloud’s managed API rather than entirely in your own environment. ([docs.llamaindex.ai][6], [GitHub][7])

---

## Docling: Fully Local, Open‑Source Parsing

* **Installation & Usage**

  ```bash

## Choosing Between Local vs. Cloud Parsing

| Criterion        | Docling (Local)              | LlamaParse/LlamaCloud (Cloud) |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Data Privacy** | Fully on‑premises            | Data sent to cloud API        |
| **Maintenance**  | You manage models & infra    | Fully managed by LlamaIndex   |
| **Scalability**  | Limited by your hardware     | Auto‑scales in cloud          |
| **Cost Model**   | One‑time (compute + storage) | Pay‑per‑use API               |
| **Availability** | Immediately available        | Private beta → GA soon        |

---

## Integrating into Your RAG Pipeline

1. **Document Loading**

   * If local: use `DoclingLoader` in LangChain or LlamaIndex’s `Document` loaders.
   * If cloud: call `LlamaParse.parse()` to get back parsed chunks.
2. **Chunking & Embeddings**

   * Both tools output structured chunks (text + table metadata) ready for embedding.
3. **Vector Store & Retrieval**

   * Plug parsed documents into Milvus, Pinecone, or your choice of vector DB.
4. **LLM Querying**

   * Use LangChain / LlamaIndex retriever components to fetch top‑K chunks, then prompt your LLM.

---

## Recommendations

* **Sensitive Data** or fully air‑gapped environments → **Docling** (local)
* **Rapid SaaS Deployment** and enterprise features → **LlamaCloud** once out of private beta
* **Hybrid**: preprocess non‑sensitive docs locally with Docling; use LlamaCloud for high‑volume or partner data

Feel free to pick the path that best aligns with your data‑security posture and scaling requirements!

### Key Points
- It seems likely that Docling offers structured, AI-ready JSON outputs for Excel files, which are useful for RAG applications.
- Research suggests Docling preserves document structure, like multiple sheets, better than standard tools like pandas.
- The evidence leans toward Docling being easier to integrate with AI frameworks, enhancing RAG system performance.

### Direct Answer

Docling can help you convert Excel files to JSON in a way that's ready for your RAG application, especially if you need JSONL format. Here's how it works and why it might be better than using regular tools like pandas:

#### What Docling Does
Docling is a tool designed to handle different document types, including Excel (XLSX files). It turns your Excel file into a structured JSON format, keeping details like sheet names and table layouts intact. This is great for RAG applications, which need organized data to retrieve and generate answers effectively.

#### Why It's Useful for RAG
- **Structured Output**: Docling treats each Excel sheet as a separate table in the JSON, making it easy to work with in your RAG system. For example, if your Excel has sales data on one sheet and customer info on another, Docling keeps them separate, which helps your AI understand the context.
- **AI-Ready Format**: It's built for AI workflows, so the JSON it creates is ready to use with tools like LangChain or LlamaIndex, saving you time on preprocessing.
- **Easy JSONL Conversion**: Since RAG often uses JSONL (where each line is a separate data chunk), you can turn Docling's JSON into JSONL by making each sheet or table a line, fitting your application's needs.

#### Compared to Pandas
With pandas, you can convert Excel to JSON, but it might not keep the structure as neatly. For instance, if you have multiple sheets, you'd need extra steps to combine them into one JSON, and it might not include metadata like sheet names. Docling does this automatically, making it simpler for AI use.

#### Example Scenario
Imagine you're building a RAG app for a company. You have an Excel file with employee data (one sheet for names, another for salaries). Using Docling, you convert it to JSON, and each sheet becomes a clear table in the output. Then, you turn it into JSONL, and your RAG system can answer questions like, "What's the average salary?" by pulling from the right sheet. With pandas, you'd need to write more code to organize the sheets, which could be time-consuming.

#### Why Choose Docling?
It's likely better for RAG because it saves time and keeps data structured, which helps your AI perform better. Plus, it's designed for AI, so it fits seamlessly into your workflow.

### Survey Note: Detailed Explanation of Docling for Excel to JSON Conversion

In this detailed exploration, we will dive into how the Docling Python package can benefit you when converting Excel files to JSON, particularly for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications that require JSONL format. We'll explain step by step, provide analogies, examples with different scenarios, and ensure you become proficient in leveraging Docling for this purpose. Finally, we'll discuss the best way to remember its output for future use.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation
Let's break this down systematically, thinking through each aspect to understand why Docling might be advantageous over standard tools like pandas.

1. **Understanding Docling's Purpose**:
   - Docling is an open-source library developed for parsing various document formats, including PDF, DOCX, and crucially, Excel (XLSX). Its primary goal is to create a unified document representation that is optimized for generative AI workflows, such as RAG systems.
   - For Excel files, Docling parses the content, treating each sheet as a table, and can export this into formats like JSON or Markdown. This is evident from documentation and examples, such as [Docling Supported Formats](https://ds4sd.github.io/docling/usage/supported_formats/), which lists XLSX as a supported input.

2. **How Docling Processes Excel Files**:
   - When you feed an Excel file into Docling, it uses AI models like layout analysis and TableFormer for structure recognition. This means it doesn't just read the data but understands the layout, including multiple sheets, tables, and potentially embedded elements.
   - For instance, if your Excel file has three sheets (e.g., "Sales," "Inventory," "Customers"), Docling represents each as a separate table in its internal document model. This is clear from a GitHub issue ([Export to markdown of multi-sheet .xlsx file](https://github.com/docling-project/docling/issues/1292)), where a user notes that Docling differentiates sheets in its `tables` attribute, with each sheet as a `TableItem` object.

3. **Converting to JSON and JSONL for RAG**:
   - Docling can export this document model to JSON, which includes structured data with metadata. For RAG applications, JSONL (JSON Lines, where each line is a JSON object) is often preferred because it allows each line to represent a separate document or chunk, facilitating retrieval.
   - You can convert Docling's JSON output to JSONL by treating each sheet or table as a separate line. For example, if you have three sheets, you could have three JSON objects, each on a new line, like:
     ```
     {"sheet": "Sales", "data": [...]}
     {"sheet": "Inventory", "data": [...]}
     {"sheet": "Customers", "data": [...]}
     ```
   - This is supported by its integration with frameworks like LangChain ([Docling with LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/docling/)), where it loads documents into a format ready for AI processing.

4. **Comparing with Pandas**:
   - With pandas, you can read an Excel file using `pd.read_excel()` and convert it to JSON with `to_json()`. However, this typically handles one sheet at a time, and combining multiple sheets into a single JSON requires additional logic. For example, you might need to loop through sheets and create a dictionary like `{"Sales": df1.to_dict(), "Inventory": df2.to_dict()}`.
   - Pandas doesn't inherently preserve metadata like sheet names in the JSON unless you explicitly include it, and it doesn't use AI models for layout analysis, which might miss complex structures.
   - Docling, on the other hand, automatically handles multiple sheets and includes structural information, making it more suitable for AI-ready outputs.

#### Analogies for Better Understanding
Think of Docling as a highly skilled librarian who not only organizes your books (Excel files) but also creates detailed catalogs (JSON) with sections for each shelf (sheet). Pandas, in contrast, is like a basic filing clerk who can list the contents of each book but might not organize them into a cohesive library system.

For RAG, imagine you're running a search engine for a library. Docling's catalog (JSON) is already tagged with shelf locations and book summaries, making it easy to find and retrieve information. Pandas' list might need extra tagging, which takes more effort.

#### Examples with Different Scenarios
Let's explore three scenarios to illustrate how Docling can be used:

1. **Scenario 1: Simple Excel with One Sheet**:
   - You have an Excel file with employee data (names, IDs, salaries) in one sheet. Using Docling, you run:
     ```python
     from docling.document_converter import DocumentConverter
     converter = DocumentConverter()
     result = converter.convert("employees.xlsx")
     json_output = result.document.export_to_json()
     ```
   - The JSON output includes the table data, and you can convert it to JSONL for RAG:
     ```python
     with open("employees.jsonl", "w") as f:
         f.write(json.dumps(json_output) + "\n")
     ```
   - This is straightforward, and Docling ensures the data is structured for AI use, unlike pandas, which might just give a flat list.

2. **Scenario 2: Multi-Sheet Excel for a Company**:
   - Your Excel has three sheets: "Sales," "Inventory," "Customers." Using Docling, the JSON output includes each sheet as a table, and you can process it for RAG:
     - Each sheet becomes a separate JSON object in JSONL, like:
       ```
       {"sheet": "Sales", "data": [{"ID": 1, "Amount": 100}, ...]}
       {"sheet": "Inventory", "data": [{"Item": "Laptop", "Qty": 50}, ...]}
       {"sheet": "Customers", "data": [{"Name": "John", "Email": "john@example.com"}, ...]}
       ```
   - This is ideal for RAG, as you can query specific sheets. With pandas, you'd need to read each sheet separately and combine them, which is more work.

3. **Scenario 3: Complex Excel with Tables and Images**:
   - Suppose your Excel has tables and embedded charts. Docling's AI models can parse the tables and potentially handle the charts, exporting them to JSON with metadata. This is useful for RAG if you need to answer questions about visual data, whereas pandas might ignore charts, focusing only on tabular data.

#### Becoming Pro with Docling
To become proficient, practice these steps:
- Install Docling with `pip install docling` and explore the documentation ([Docling GitHub Repository](https://github.com/docling-project/docling)).
- Start with simple Excel files, convert them to JSON, and experiment with JSONL for RAG.
- Use integrations like LangChain or LlamaIndex ([RAG over Excel Sheets with Docling](https://blog.dailydoseofds.com/p/hands-on-rag-over-excel-sheets)) to see how it fits into your workflow.
- Try multi-sheet files to understand how Docling handles structure, and compare with pandas to see the difference.

#### Best Way to Remember Docling's Output
Think of Docling's output as a "smart map" of your Excel file: it shows all the roads (sheets) and landmarks (tables) in a way that's ready for AI navigation (RAG). Remember, it's like a librarian who not only lists the books but also organizes them for easy searching, with each sheet as a chapter in the JSON story.

When we trying to create a rag application the input was as part of our company specific we have to use a Json format which is like a JSON and what exactly they are saying is it is about the chunking strategy is all depend upon your JSONL file you do not know so previously we were trying to for any other text files we are trying to mention the chunking strategy in the drop down of the company specific strategies  but when you are using a JSONL file we do not have it in UI we have to define own custom chunking strategy is all depend upon your JSONL file and they are also saying the JSONL format should be like having a raw context a chunk id a metadata presentation context enhanced context like this in the Jungle so is it like curve so what exactly is this when like curve so whenever we are creating a Jason file it is all depend upon our  chunking strategy 

Can you give any inputs on this so any other way around can we create this json files I'm trying to convert Excel with multiple sheets into Json L file so when I'm trying to convert the context would be like it is like each sheet is one context I want to make it so whenever it is whenever we are trying to create a prompt and looking for an answer it has to look over the whole sheet rather than each row the reason I was saying is like all rows are dependent on each other like it is a metadata of an ETL process So when we are asking about any particular process or a data pipeline how the flow happens it has to cheque the whole sheet rather than each row so that even the data lineage will also come up effectively that's the reason I was asking can we create a chunking on a whole sheet rather than each row what your inputs are suggestion on that


Answer

To address your requirement of chunking entire Excel sheets into a JSONL format for your RAG application, here's a structured approach:

### 1. **JSONL Structure Design**
Each JSON object in the JSONL file should represent a **single sheet** from your Excel file. Use these key fields:
- **`chunk_id`**: Unique identifier (e.g., `filename_sheetname`).
- **`raw_context`**: Raw sheet data (e.g., a list of rows as dictionaries).
- **`metadata`**: Context about the sheet (e.g., filename, sheet name, timestamp).
- **`presentation_context`**: Human-readable format (e.g., a markdown table).
- **`enhanced_context`**: Processed/summarized version of the sheet (optional).

#### Example JSONL Entry:
```json
{
  "chunk_id": "etl_process_flows_sheet1",
  "metadata": {
    "source_file": "etl_process_flows.xlsx",
    "sheet_name": "DataPipeline1",
    "description": "ETL pipeline for customer data"
  },
  "raw_context": [
    {"step": 1, "action": "Extract", "source": "DB_A"},
    {"step": 2, "action": "Transform", "logic": "Clean nulls"},
    {"step": 3, "action": "Load", "target": "Warehouse_X"}
  ],
  "presentation_context": "| Step | Action      | Source/Target |\n|------|-------------|---------------|\n| 1    | Extract     | DB_A          |\n| 2    | Transform   | Clean nulls   |\n| 3    | Load        | Warehouse_X   |",
  "enhanced_context": "This sheet outlines a 3-step ETL process for customer data: extraction from DB_A, transformation to clean nulls, and loading into Warehouse_X."
}
```

---

### 2. **Excel-to-JSONL Conversion Workflow**
Use Python to automate the conversion:

#### Step 1: Read Excel Sheets
```python
import pandas as pd
import json

excel_file = "etl_process_flows.xlsx"
sheets = pd.read_excel(excel_file, sheet_name=None)
```

#### Step 2: Process Each Sheet
```python
jsonl_data = []

for sheet_name, df in sheets.items():
    # Generate chunk ID (e.g., filename + sheetname)
    chunk_id = f"{excel_file}_{sheet_name}"
    
    # Extract raw context (list of rows as dictionaries)
    raw_context = df.to_dict(orient="records")
    
    # Build metadata
    metadata = {
        "source_file": excel_file,
        "sheet_name": sheet_name,
        "num_rows": len(df)
    }
    
    # Create presentation context (markdown table)
    presentation_context = df.to_markdown()
    
    # Generate enhanced context (summarize the sheet)
    enhanced_context = f"This sheet describes {len(df)} steps in the {sheet_name} ETL pipeline."
    
    # Compile JSON object
    json_obj = {
        "chunk_id": chunk_id,
        "metadata": metadata,
        "raw_context": raw_context,
        "presentation_context": presentation_context,
        "enhanced_context": enhanced_context
    }
    jsonl_data.append(json_obj)
```

#### Step 3: Write to JSONL File
```python
with open("output.jsonl", "w") as f:
    for entry in jsonl_data:
        f.write(json.dumps(entry) + "\n")
```

---

### 3. **Custom Chunking Strategy**
Since your UI doesn’t support JSONL chunking, implement a custom strategy in code:
- Treat **each JSONL line as a single chunk** (one sheet = one chunk).
- Use `raw_context` or `enhanced_context` for embeddings/retrieval.

#### Example RAG Integration (Python):
```python
from langchain.document_loaders import JSONLoader

loader = JSONLoader(
    file_path="output.jsonl",
    jq_schema=".[]",
    content_key="raw_context"  # or "enhanced_context"
)

docs = loader.load()
```

---

### 4. **Handling Large Sheets**
If a sheet exceeds your model’s token limit (e.g., 4096 tokens for GPT-4):
- **Truncate**: Keep critical columns/rows.
- **Summarize**: Use LLMs to generate shorter `enhanced_context`.
- **Split Strategically**: Break sheets into logical subgroups (e.g., by section headers).

---

### 5. **Why This Works**
- **Data Lineage**: By treating an entire sheet as a chunk, the RAG system retrieves all interdependent rows, preserving context for ETL/metadata queries.
- **JSONL Flexibility**: You control the schema to include fields like `presentation_context` for readability and `metadata` for filtering.

---

### 6. **Validation**
Test with queries like:
- *“Explain the data flow for Warehouse_X.”*
- *“What transformations are applied to DB_A data?”*

Ensure the retrieved chunks include the full sheet context.
