### **Chapter 1: Retrieving Records**

**Overview:**
- Focuses on fundamental `SELECT` statements.
- Establishes a foundation for more complex SQL queries and daily database interactions.

---

#### **1.1 Retrieving All Rows and Columns from a Table**

- **Problem:** View all data in a table.
- **Solution:** Use `SELECT * FROM table_name;`
  ```sql
  SELECT *
    FROM emp;
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - The `*` wildcard returns every column and, without a `WHERE` clause, all rows.
  - **Alternative:** Explicitly list columns for clarity and maintainability.
    ```sql
    SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, mgr, hiredate, comm, deptno
      FROM emp;
    ```
  - **Best Practices:**
    - **Ad Hoc Queries:** `SELECT *` is convenient.
    - **Program Code:** Specify columns to ensure clarity, avoid unexpected column changes, and enhance readability.

---

#### **1.2 Retrieving a Subset of Rows from a Table**

- **Problem:** View only rows that meet specific conditions.
- **Solution:** Utilize the `WHERE` clause.
  ```sql
  SELECT *
    FROM emp
   WHERE deptno = 10;
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on the specified condition.
  - Supports operators like `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `<>`, `AND`, `OR`.
  - Allows for complex filtering by combining multiple conditions.

---

#### **1.3 Finding Rows That Satisfy Multiple Conditions**

- **Problem:** Return rows meeting multiple criteria.
- **Solution:** Combine `WHERE` with `AND`, `OR`, and parentheses.
  ```sql
  SELECT *
    FROM emp
   WHERE deptno = 10
      OR comm IS NOT NULL
      OR (sal <= 2000 AND deptno = 20);
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`) and parentheses control the evaluation order.
  - **Example Explained:**
    - Employees in department 10.
    - Employees with a non-null commission.
    - Employees in department 20 earning ≤ $2,000.
  - **Alternative Query with Parentheses:**
    ```sql
    SELECT *
      FROM emp
     WHERE (deptno = 10
            OR comm IS NOT NULL
            OR sal <= 2000)
       AND deptno = 20;
    ```
    - Requires department 20 and any of the other conditions.

---

#### **1.4 Retrieving a Subset of Columns from a Table**

- **Problem:** View specific columns instead of all.
- **Solution:** Specify desired columns in the `SELECT` clause.
  ```sql
  SELECT ename, deptno, sal
    FROM emp;
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - Reduces data retrieval overhead, especially over networks.
  - Enhances query clarity and performance.
  - Avoids unnecessary data handling in applications.

---

#### **1.5 Providing Meaningful Names for Columns**

- **Problem:** Make column names more readable and understandable.
- **Solution:** Use the `AS` keyword to alias columns.
  ```sql
  SELECT sal AS salary, comm AS commission
    FROM emp;
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - **Aliasing:** Assigns new, meaningful names to columns in the result set.
  - Improves readability for users and maintainers.
  - Facilitates easier error tracing when columns are explicitly named.

---

#### **1.6 Referencing an Aliased Column in the WHERE Clause**

- **Problem:** Use aliased column names in the `WHERE` clause.
- **Solution:** Employ an inline view (subquery) to reference aliases.
  ```sql
  SELECT *
    FROM (
      SELECT sal AS salary, comm AS commission
        FROM emp
    ) x
   WHERE salary < 5000;
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - **Order of Evaluation:** `WHERE` is processed before `SELECT`, so aliases aren't directly accessible.
  - **Inline View:** Encapsulates the aliased columns, making them available to the outer `WHERE` clause.
  - **Tip:** Always alias inline views where required, as some databases mandate it.

---

#### **1.7 Concatenating Column Values**

- **Problem:** Combine values from multiple columns into one.
- **Solution:** Use database-specific concatenation methods.
  - **DB2, Oracle, PostgreSQL:** Use `||`
    ```sql
    SELECT ename || ' WORKS AS A ' || job AS msg
      FROM emp
     WHERE deptno = 10;
    ```
  - **MySQL:** Use `CONCAT` function
    ```sql
    SELECT CONCAT(ename, ' WORKS AS A ', job) AS msg
      FROM emp
     WHERE deptno = 10;
    ```
  - **SQL Server:** Use `+` operator
    ```sql
    SELECT ename + ' WORKS AS A ' + job AS msg
      FROM emp
     WHERE deptno = 10;
    ```
- **Discussion:**
  - **Purpose:** Create more descriptive or formatted output by merging column values.
  - **Best Practice:** Use aliases for the concatenated result for clarity.

---

#### **1.8 Using Conditional Logic in a SELECT Statement**

- **Problem:** Implement IF-ELSE logic within `SELECT`.
- **Solution:** Utilize the `CASE` expression.
  ```sql
  SELECT ename, sal,
         CASE 
           WHEN sal <= 2000 THEN 'UNDERPAID'
           WHEN sal >= 4000 THEN 'OVERPAID'
           ELSE 'OK'
         END AS status
    FROM emp;
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - **CASE Expression:** Facilitates conditional transformations directly in queries.
  - **Aliases:** Assign meaningful names to the result of `CASE`.
  - **ELSE Clause:** Optional; defaults to `NULL` if omitted.
  - **Alternative:** Use `COALESCE` or nested `CASE` for similar outcomes.

---

#### **1.9 Limiting the Number of Rows Returned**

- **Problem:** Restrict the number of rows returned by a query.
- **Solution:** Use database-specific clauses to limit rows.
  - **DB2:**
    ```sql
    SELECT *
      FROM emp FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;
    ```
  - **MySQL & PostgreSQL:**
    ```sql
    SELECT *
      FROM emp LIMIT 5;
    ```
  - **Oracle:**
    ```sql
    SELECT *
      FROM emp
     WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
    ```
  - **SQL Server:**
    ```sql
    SELECT TOP 5 *
      FROM emp;
    ```
- **Discussion:**
  - **Vendor Differences:** Each DBMS has its own syntax for row limiting.
  - **Oracle’s ROWNUM:** Assigns numbers sequentially as rows are fetched.
    - **Important:** `ROWNUM = 5` never returns results because rows are numbered starting at 1 and only rows ≤ 5 are returned.
    - **Workaround:** Use `ROWNUM <= 5` to fetch the first five rows.
  - **Best Practices:** Choose the appropriate method based on the DBMS in use.

---

#### **1.10 Returning n Random Records from a Table**

- **Problem:** Fetch a specific number of random rows, with varying results on each execution.
- **Solution:** Combine random functions with `ORDER BY` and row limiting.
  - **DB2:**
    ```sql
    SELECT ename, job
      FROM emp
     ORDER BY RAND() FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;
    ```
  - **MySQL:**
    ```sql
    SELECT ename, job
      FROM emp
     ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 5;
    ```
  - **PostgreSQL:**
    ```sql
    SELECT ename, job
      FROM emp
     ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5;
    ```
  - **Oracle:**
    ```sql
    SELECT *
      FROM (
        SELECT ename, job
          FROM emp
        ORDER BY DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE()
      )
     WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
    ```
  - **SQL Server:**
    ```sql
    SELECT TOP 5 ename, job
      FROM emp
     ORDER BY NEWID();
    ```
- **Discussion:**
  - **ORDER BY with Random Function:** Randomizes the order of rows.
  - **Row Limiting:** Ensures only the desired number of random rows are returned.
  - **Caution:** Avoid confusing random functions with numeric constants in `ORDER BY`, which reference column positions instead.

---

#### **1.11 Finding Null Values**

- **Problem:** Identify rows where a specific column is `NULL`.
- **Solution:** Use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`.
  ```sql
  SELECT *
    FROM emp
   WHERE comm IS NULL;
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - **NULL Comparisons:** `NULL` cannot be compared using `=`, `!=`, or other standard operators.
  - **Use Cases:**
    - `IS NULL`: Finds rows where the column is `NULL`.
    - `IS NOT NULL`: Finds rows where the column has a non-`NULL` value.

---

#### **1.12 Transforming Nulls into Real Values**

- **Problem:** Replace `NULL` values with actual values in query results.
- **Solution:** Use the `COALESCE` function.
  ```sql
  SELECT COALESCE(comm, 0)
    FROM emp;
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - **COALESCE Function:** Returns the first non-`NULL` value from the provided arguments.
    - Example: If `comm` is not `NULL`, return `comm`; otherwise, return `0`.
  - **Alternative:** Use `CASE` expressions for similar transformations.
    ```sql
    SELECT CASE
             WHEN comm IS NOT NULL THEN comm
             ELSE 0
           END
      FROM emp;
    ```
  - **Best Practice:** `COALESCE` is more succinct and widely supported across DBMSs.

---

#### **1.13 Searching for Patterns**

- **Problem:** Retrieve rows matching specific substrings or patterns.
- **Solution:** Utilize the `LIKE` operator with wildcards.
  ```sql
  SELECT ename, job
    FROM emp
   WHERE deptno IN (10, 20)
     AND (ename LIKE '%I%' OR job LIKE '%ER');
  ```
- **Discussion:**
  - **Wildcards:**
    - `%`: Matches any sequence of characters.
    - `_`: Matches a single character.
  - **Pattern Placement:**
    - `%I%`: Contains an "I" anywhere in the string.
    - `%ER`: Ends with "ER".
    - `ER%`: Starts with "ER".
  - **Use Cases:** Flexible string matching for filtering data based on patterns.

---
