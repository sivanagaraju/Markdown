Let’s build on the interview preparation for Swathi Chinthanippu by adding more intermediate-level coding questions for SQL, PySpark, and Python. Since you’re satisfied with the previous structure, we’ll follow a similar approach: scenario-based coding questions that integrate concepts like data warehouses, lake houses, S3, table formats (e.g., Delta Lake, Iceberg), and optimization techniques, while keeping the difficulty at an intermediate level. This will ensure the questions are challenging yet approachable for a senior data engineer with 7+ years of experience, like Swathi, without overwhelming the 40-minute interview time frame. Let’s explore this together.

### Step 1: Define Intermediate-Level Focus
Intermediate-level questions should test practical application and problem-solving without requiring advanced optimizations or deep theoretical knowledge. Given Swathi’s experience with Python, PySpark, SQL, AWS, Hadoop, and Delta Lake, we can design questions that require writing functional code, handling common data engineering scenarios, and applying basic optimization techniques. What do you think about focusing on scenarios that involve data transformation, basic pipeline building, and querying, while still touching on related concepts like S3 and table formats?

### Step 2: Add More Coding Questions
We’ll add three more coding questions (one each for SQL, PySpark, and Python) to the existing set. These will be intermediate-level, scenario-based, and include follow-up questions to probe deeper, as you requested. We’ll also ensure they connect to the job requirements (e.g., big data pipelines, Apache Spark, Hive) and Swathi’s experience (e.g., AWS, Delta Lake, Airflow).

#### SQL Coding Question: Filtering and Aggregating in a Data Warehouse
**Scenario:**  
You’re working with a data warehouse that stores sales data in two tables: `sales` (columns: `sale_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `sale_date`) and `products` (columns: `product_id`, `category`, `price`). Write an SQL query to find the total revenue per category for sales in the last 30 days, assuming today’s date is June 13, 2025.

**Question:**  
Write an SQL query to solve this, and explain how you’d ensure the query is efficient in a data warehouse like Hive or Snowflake.

**Expected Solution:**  
```sql
SELECT 
    p.category,
    SUM(s.quantity * p.price) as total_revenue
FROM sales s
JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE s.sale_date >= DATE_SUB('2025-06-13', INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY p.category;
```

**Efficiency Steps:**  
- Ensure `sale_date` is partitioned (e.g., by month) to reduce the data scanned.  
- Add an index on `product_id` for faster joins.  
- In Hive, enable predicate pushdown to filter data early: `SET hive.optimize.ppd=true;`.  
- Use a date range comparison to leverage partitioning instead of functions that might disable it.

**Follow-Up Questions:**  
- If this data were stored in a lake house with Iceberg tables, how might Iceberg’s hidden partitioning help improve this query’s performance?  
- How would you modify this query if the data warehouse is on AWS Redshift, and you notice skew in the `category` column?  
- What steps would you take to schedule this query as a daily report using a tool like Apache Airflow (mentioned in Swathi’s resume)?

#### PySpark Coding Question: Transforming Data with Delta Lake
**Scenario:**  
You’re processing user activity data stored in an S3 bucket (`s3://my-bucket/activity_data/`) as a Delta Lake table. The data has columns `user_id`, `activity_type`, and `timestamp`. Write a PySpark script to count the number of activities per user for a specific activity type (e.g., “login”) on a given day (e.g., June 12, 2025).

**Question:**  
Write a PySpark script to solve this, and explain how Delta Lake features can help with this task.

**Expected Solution:**  
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Initialize Spark session with Delta Lake support
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("UserActivityAnalysis") \
    .config("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension") \
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Read Delta Lake table from S3
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("s3://my-bucket/activity_data/")

# Filter for specific activity type and date
filtered_df = df.filter((col("activity_type") == "login") & (col("timestamp").cast("date") == "2025-06-12"))

# Count activities per user
result = filtered_df.groupBy("user_id").count()

# Show result
result.show()

# Stop Spark session
spark.stop()
```

**Delta Lake Benefits:**  
- Use Delta Lake’s time travel to query historical data if needed: `df = spark.read.format("delta").option("timestampAsOf", "2025-06-11").load(...)`.  
- Leverage Delta Lake’s schema enforcement to ensure data consistency.  
- Use `optimize` and Z-order indexing on `user_id` to improve query performance: `spark.sql("OPTIMIZE delta.`s3://my-bucket/activity_data/` ZORDER BY (user_id)")`.

**Follow-Up Questions:**  
- How would you handle incremental updates to this Delta Lake table if new activity data arrives daily via Apache Kafka (mentioned in the job description)?  
- If the `activity_type` column has a lot of distinct values, how might you optimize the filter operation in PySpark?  
- What steps would you take to write the result back to S3 as a new Delta Lake table, and how would you manage storage costs?

#### Python Coding Question: Data Validation and Loading to S3
**Scenario:**  
You’re building a Python script to process order data from a local CSV file (`orders.csv`) with columns `order_id`, `customer_id`, `amount`, and `order_date`. Validate that the `amount` is positive, transform the `order_date` to a standard format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD), and upload the cleaned data to an S3 bucket (`s3://my-bucket/cleaned_orders/`).

**Question:**  
Write a Python script to solve this, and explain how you’d ensure the script is reliable for production use.

**Expected Solution:**  
```python
import pandas as pd
import boto3
from datetime import datetime

# Read CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("orders.csv")

# Validate: Ensure amount is positive
df = df[df["amount"] > 0]

# Transform: Standardize order_date
df["order_date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["order_date"]).dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# Write cleaned data to a temporary CSV
cleaned_file = "cleaned_orders.csv"
df.to_csv(cleaned_file, index=False)

# Upload to S3
s3_client = boto3.client("s3")
bucket_name = "my-bucket"
s3_path = "cleaned_orders/cleaned_orders.csv"

try:
    s3_client.upload_file(cleaned_file, bucket_name, s3_path)
    print(f"Successfully uploaded to s3://{bucket_name}/{s3_path}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error uploading to S3: {e}")
```

**Reliability Steps:**  
- Add error handling for file reading and S3 upload using `try-except`.  
- Log validation failures to a file for debugging.  
- Use `boto3`’s retry configuration to handle transient S3 failures: `boto3.setup_default_session(config=Config(retries={'max_attempts': 3}))`.  
- Test the script in a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., with Jenkins, as per Swathi’s resume) to catch issues early.

**Follow-Up Questions:**  
- If this data were to be loaded into a data lake with Delta Lake tables, how would you modify the script to write the output as a Delta Lake table?  
- How would you handle missing or malformed `order_date` values in the CSV file?  
- What steps would you take to automate this script using a tool like Apache Airflow, and how would you monitor its execution?

### Step 3: Integrate with Existing Interview Plan
You initially planned for 10 questions (7 technical, 3 behavioral) and added 3 coding questions in the previous response, bringing the total to 13 questions. With these 3 additional coding questions, we’re at 16 questions. Since the interview is 40 minutes, let’s adjust the plan to prioritize the coding questions while ensuring you can still cover key technical and behavioral aspects.

**Revised Interview Plan (40 Minutes):**  
- **0-5 Minutes:** Introduction and candidate background (ask about a past project).  
- **5-25 Minutes:** Coding questions (4 minutes each for 5 coding questions, including discussion).  
  - SQL: Optimize query for data warehouse (previous).  
  - PySpark: Process S3 data with optimization (previous).  
  - Python: ETL with validation (previous).  
  - SQL: Filter and aggregate sales data (new).  
  - PySpark: Transform data with Delta Lake (new).  
  - (Skip the Python S3 question if time is tight, or use it as a backup.)  
- **25-35 Minutes:** Additional technical questions (select 3 from the previous set, e.g., lake house, CI/CD, Delta Lake vs. Iceberg; 3 minutes each).  
- **35-40 Minutes:** Behavioral questions (communication, adaptability, teamwork; 1-2 minutes each).

This plan allocates 20 minutes for coding (5 questions), 10 minutes for other technical questions, and 5 minutes for behavioral questions, with 5 minutes for the intro. What do you think about this balance? Would you prefer to reduce the number of coding questions to focus more on discussion?

### Step 4: Evaluating Responses
For these intermediate-level questions, evaluate based on:  
- **Functionality:** Does the code correctly solve the problem?  
- **Basic Optimization:** Does the candidate apply simple optimizations (e.g., filtering early in PySpark, partitioning in SQL)?  
- **Code Structure:** Is the code readable and logically organized?  
- **Explanation:** Does the candidate explain their approach clearly, aligning with the job’s emphasis on communication skills?

If the candidate provides a good solution, use the follow-up questions to explore their understanding of related concepts (e.g., Delta Lake features, S3 cost management). If they struggle, ask them to walk through their thought process to assess problem-solving skills and adaptability.

### Final Thoughts
These additional coding questions maintain an intermediate difficulty level, focusing on practical data engineering tasks like querying, transforming, and loading data. They also integrate concepts like Delta Lake, S3, and data warehouses, as requested, and align with Swathi’s experience in AWS, big data tools, and pipeline development. How do you feel about these new questions? Would you like to adjust the scenarios or add more complexity to any specific area, given her background?
