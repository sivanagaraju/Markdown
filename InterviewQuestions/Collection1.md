Here’s a focused set of 10 scenario-based technical and behavioral interview questions for a Senior Data Engineer or Senior Software Engineer role, covering PySpark, Python, SQL, data warehousing, lakehouse concepts, object storage, optimization, CI/CD, and communication/behavioral fit. For each, I provide different approaches and indicate which is best.

## 1. **Scenario: Data Transformation in PySpark**

**Question:**  
You have a dataset with millions of records containing customer transactions stored in a CSV file on S3. You need to aggregate total sales per customer and write the result back as a Delta Lake table. How would you approach this in PySpark?

**Approaches:**  
- **Read CSV from S3 using Spark’s DataFrame API, perform groupBy aggregation, and write as Delta table.**
- Use RDDs for transformation and aggregation, then convert to DataFrame for writing.
- Use SQL queries via Spark SQL after registering the DataFrame as a temporary view.

**Best Approach:**  
Use the DataFrame API for both reading and transformation, then write as Delta table. It’s optimized for performance, leverages Spark’s Catalyst optimizer, and integrates seamlessly with S3 and Delta Lake[1][2].

## 2. **Scenario: SQL Optimization**

**Question:**  
Given a slow-running SQL query that joins multiple large tables and includes several subqueries, what steps would you take to optimize it?

**Approaches:**  
- Add appropriate indexes and review execution plans.
- Rewrite the query to reduce subqueries and use JOINs efficiently.
- Limit the use of SELECT *, avoid DISTINCT, and retrieve only necessary columns.
- Partition large tables and use materialized views for frequent aggregations.

**Best Approach:**  
Combine indexing, query rewriting, and selective column retrieval. Always analyze the execution plan to identify bottlenecks, and use partitioning/materialized views for large datasets[3][4].

---

## 3. **Scenario: Handling Data Skew in PySpark**

**Question:**  
You notice that a Spark job is running slowly due to data skew during a join operation. How would you resolve this?

**Approaches:**  
- Use salting techniques to distribute skewed keys.
- Broadcast the smaller DataFrame if possible.
- Increase the number of partitions or use custom partitioning.

**Best Approach:**  
If one table is small, use broadcast join. For large tables, apply salting to distribute skewed keys and optimize partitioning[2].

---

## 4. **Scenario: Incremental Data Loading**

**Question:**  
How would you implement incremental data loading from an OLTP database to a data warehouse using PySpark and SQL?

**Approaches:**  
- Use timestamps or CDC (Change Data Capture) columns to identify new/updated records.
- Extract only changed data, load into a staging table, and merge (upsert) into the warehouse.
- Use MERGE statements or Delta Lake’s merge API for efficient upserts.

**Best Approach:**  
Use CDC/timestamps to extract only new/changed data, load into staging, and use Delta Lake’s merge API or SQL MERGE for efficient upserts[5][6].

---

## 5. **Scenario: Data Lakehouse Table Formats**

**Question:**  
What are the differences between Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, and Hudi table formats? When would you choose one over the others?

**Approaches:**  
- Delta Lake: Strong ACID compliance, time travel, easy integration with Databricks/Spark.
- Iceberg: Open standard, supports schema evolution, used in AWS Athena, Snowflake, etc.
- Hudi: Focuses on streaming ingestion and upserts, popular with incremental data pipelines.

**Best Approach:**  
Choose based on ecosystem and requirements:  
- Delta Lake for Databricks/Spark-centric workflows and ACID needs.  
- Iceberg for open standards and multi-engine compatibility.  
- Hudi for streaming/upsert-heavy use cases[1][2].

---

## 6. **Scenario: Object Storage Integration**

**Question:**  
How would you efficiently read and write large datasets between Spark and object storage like AWS S3 or GCP GCS?

**Approaches:**  
- Use Spark’s native connectors for S3/GCS with optimized file formats (Parquet, ORC, Delta).
- Tune Spark configurations for parallelism and throughput (e.g., partition size, max connections).
- Implement checkpointing and fault tolerance for large jobs.

**Best Approach:**  
Use optimized formats (Parquet/Delta), Spark’s native connectors, and tune parallelism settings for efficient I/O. Avoid small files problem by coalescing output[1][2].

---

## 7. **Scenario: SQL Window Functions**

**Question:**  
Write a SQL query to calculate a 7-day moving average of daily sales for each product.

**Approaches:**  
- Use window functions (e.g., `AVG(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sales_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`).
- Use subqueries with self-joins to aggregate over 7 days.

**Best Approach:**  
Window functions are more efficient and readable for moving averages[6].

---

## 8. **Scenario: CI/CD for Data Pipelines**

**Question:**  
How would you set up a CI/CD pipeline for deploying PySpark jobs to production?

**Approaches:**  
- Use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate build, test, and deployment.
- Containerize jobs using Docker and deploy to a cluster.
- Implement automated testing, linting, and version control integration.

**Best Approach:**  
Automate build/test/deploy with a CI/CD tool, containerize jobs for consistency, and use version control and automated testing for reliability[7][8].

---

## 9. **Scenario: Catalogs and Table Metadata Management**

**Question:**  
How do you manage and track metadata for tables in a data lakehouse environment?

**Approaches:**  
- Use a metastore/catalog service (e.g., Hive Metastore, AWS Glue, Unity Catalog).
- Implement versioning and schema evolution tracking.
- Use table formats like Delta/Iceberg that natively support metadata management.

**Best Approach:**  
Leverage a dedicated catalog/metastore and use modern table formats with built-in metadata/versioning[1][2].

---

## 10. **Behavioral/Communication: Adaptability and Teamwork**

**Question:**  
Describe a time when you had to quickly adapt to a new technology or process. How did you approach the learning curve, and how did you communicate changes to your team?

**Approaches:**  
- Proactively research and experiment with the new technology/process.
- Seek help from peers or online communities.
- Document findings and share best practices with the team.
- Conduct knowledge-sharing sessions.

**Best Approach:**  
Demonstrate proactive learning, clear communication, and collaboration—showing both adaptability and strong communication skills, which are key for team fit[9][10].
