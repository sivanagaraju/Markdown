Communicate with Teams More Effectively
Contributed by Charles Humble

Difficulty level: Intermediate

In offices, synchronous communication (mostly in the form of meetings) is the default. This causes a range of problems, including too many meetings, constant interruptions, and feeling like you have to respond to everything immediately. It is particularly problematic for us as IT professionals since our work is what Cal Newport calls “deep work” in his book of the same name, requiring sustained and deep concentration to do it effectively.

In this Shortcut, we’ll look at how we can overcome these challenges and help create a sympathetic framework for team communication.

Synchronous Communication
Synchronous communication has the highest productivity cost and should therefore only be used sparingly.

Meetings have measurable costs; one recent study estimated that companies could save $25,000 per employee per year by eliminating unnecessary ones. Moreover, if you have eight engineers in a meeting for one hour, you’ve lost an entire working day of engineering time. Factor in any preparation they needed to do before the meeting, pausing the work they were doing and subsequently resuming it, and the full impact is likely higher.

For all communication, try to make your expectations explicit. Ahead of meetings, include an agenda with the meeting invite. This means that everyone knows what to expect, and can tell you if they feel they don’t need to attend. Limit meeting length—experiment with 30 or 45 minutes rather than defaulting to an hour or more.

If you are a manager, regularly review the meetings you have with your team and consider whether they are essential. If any are purely status meetings, they could be handled via email or a tool such as 15Five.

Two meetings that I consider essential are weekly departmental meetings and one-on-ones.

For the departmental meeting, I recommend starting with a check-in where everyone gives a quick update on how they are doing; the Core Protocols has a format for this, but I’ve found that a less formal update is equally effective and feels more natural. Check-ins help team cohesion, and provide an opportunity for you to telegraph psychological safety by sharing something personal—“I’m having some health issues and don’t know what’s causing it. Apologies if I’m not as focused as I should be.”

I also recommend weekly one-on-ones with all direct reports. They provide an opportunity for your team members to talk about whatever they want, and for this reason I try to keep them informal, but I do recommend keeping notes in a shared document you can both review. Camille Fournier’s book, The Manager’s Path, has excellent advice on this topic. I will say I have been challenged more than once when recommending one-on-ones; a manager may feel that they don’t have time to have them regularly while also providing effective coaching and technical leadership. I’d argue, however, that this is a sign that their team is too big for them to manage effectively, rather than an issue with the advice.

Feedback and praise should always be given synchronously. Fournier notes that for something that requires immediate correction, such as insulting a colleague or using inappropriate language, you should try and give the feedback as soon as possible after the event. The longer you wait, the harder it is to give and the less effective it will be. I’ll note as well that while giving this kind of feedback is never easy, it can be absolutely invaluable. Particularly early in our careers, many of us exhibit behaviors that are unhelpful in a work context (such as being overly assertive) and we may not even know that we’re doing it. A manager who points this out gives us the opportunity to correct something before it becomes a major issue.

And don’t forget to give praise. Positive feedback given freely in the moment is always welcome.

Asynchronous Communication
For asynchronous channels, a simple communication policy is useful because it makes expectations explicit. It doesn’t need to be anything terribly complex; a simple table will suffice:

Channel	When to use	Expected Response Time
WhatsApp	Emergency	Immediate
Slack	When blocked	3 hours
Email	Non-urgent	24 hours
For a manager, having well-established communication channels means that individual employees can challenge you if you are being unreasonable and suggest ways that policies could be improved. It also makes it possible for everyone to establish a routine for dealing with asynchronous channels, and to use tools like “Do not disturb” to reduce interruptions. This matters because, as Sarah Wells points out in her book, Enabling Microservice Success, “Moving people out of flow is costly: it takes time for people to get back into the mindspace they were in after an interruption.”

Finally, when using asynchronous channels, make sure your messages are self-contained. For example, if you are bringing someone into a thread on Slack, avoid a situation where someone has to scroll through hundreds of previous messages. Rather than saying, “Hey Jane, what do you think?”, you could write something like, “Hey Jane, what do you think about us switching from component A to component B, given the performance problems we’re seeing with component A?” Jane can respond faster because you have provided all the context she needs.

The overarching theme here is to look at reducing interruptions. Are you overly reliant on synchronous communication? If you are having too many in-person meetings, can their length be reduced or can any be cut altogether? Are expectations clear? Can you use “do not disturb” as a method to reduce notifications when you need to concentrate? When you bring someone into a conversation, are you giving them the context they need to quickly reach a decision? Each of these changes won’t have a huge individual impact—but if you can apply all of them, engineers should end up able to spend more time in flow.
