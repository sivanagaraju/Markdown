# Spark Data Partitioning in Local vs Cluster Mode

## Introduction to Partitioning and Parallelism 
In Apache Spark, **partitions** are the fundamental units of parallelism. A partition is a chunk of data that can be processed by one task on a single core. Spark will create one task for each partition, and tasks are executed in parallel on the available cores across the cluster. The number of partitions thus directly influences parallelism and performance. Generally, more partitions allow greater parallelism (more tasks running concurrently), but too many partitions can introduce overhead, while too few can underutilize resources ([RDD Programming Guide - Spark 3.5.5 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#:~:text=One%20important%20parameter%20for%20parallel,to%20maintain%20backward%20compatibility)) ([RDD Programming Guide - Spark 3.5.5 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#:~:text=,have%20fewer%20partitions%20than%20blocks)). 

**Local vs. Cluster Mode:** Spark’s behavior in local mode (all tasks on one machine) vs cluster mode (distributed across multiple machines) affects default parallelism. In *local mode*, the default number of partitions (for RDD operations without an explicit setting) is the number of cores on the local machine. For example, using `SparkSession.builder.master("local[4]")` on a 4-core laptop would default to 4 partitions for new RDDs. In cluster deployments (e.g., YARN or Spark Standalone), Spark uses the total cores across *all executors* (or 2, whichever is larger) as the default parallelism. This means if you have 5 worker nodes each with 8 cores (40 cores total), Spark might default to 40 partitions for RDDs created without a specified partition count. The configuration `spark.default.parallelism` governs this setting and can be tuned; if not set, it is determined by the scheduler: local = number of cores, Mesos fine-grained = 8, others = total cores or 2. By contrast, Spark’s SQL engine (DataFrame/Dataset API) uses a separate default for shuffle operations: `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`, which defaults to 200 partitions for wide operations like joins and aggregations. We will discuss these defaults in detail and how they influence data partitioning.

## How Spark Partitions Data by Default

Spark automatically partitions data at various stages: when reading input data, when transforming data (especially with shuffles), and when writing output. Understanding Spark’s default partitioning behavior in different scenarios will help us manage parallelism:

### Default Parallelism and Configurations 
Spark uses two key configurations for default partitioning:
- **`spark.default.parallelism`:** Controls the default number of partitions for RDD operations (and influences some file reads). It has no single fixed value – it’s derived from the environment. For RDDs with no parent (created from scratch), Spark picks a default based on the master:
  - *Local mode:* equal to the number of cores on the machine.
  - *Cluster mode:* equal to the total number of cores in the cluster (all executors combined), or 2 if that total is less than 2. For example, if you have 16 cores across executors, default parallelism would be 16 (unless explicitly set higher).
  - *Mesos fine-grained:* uses 8 by default.
  
  This setting affects RDD operations like `sc.parallelize()` and default partitions for certain transformations (e.g., `reduceByKey` on RDDs) if you don’t provide a partition count ([performance - What is the difference between spark.sql.shuffle.partitions and spark.default.parallelism? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45704156/what-is-the-difference-between-spark-sql-shuffle-partitions-and-spark-default-pa#:~:text=,In%20DataSourceScanExec%27s)). It also serves as a fallback for input file partitioning when no other hint is available (Spark may use it as a minimum number of partitions when reading files).
  
- **`spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`:** Controls the number of partitions used by Spark SQL for shuffle operations on DataFrames/Datasets. By default, it is 200. This means after operations like `join()`, `groupBy().agg()`, or any wide transformation on a DataFrame, the result will be partitioned into 200 partitions (unless you change this or use hints). This default (200) is static and not based on cluster size, so in a very large cluster 200 might be too low (causing big partitions), while in a small local job it might be too high (causing many tiny tasks). It’s a critical tuning parameter for Spark SQL workloads.

**Relationship between these:** In general, use `spark.default.parallelism` for RDD-based code and as a guide for input splitting, and `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` for DataFrame/Dataset (Spark SQL) operations. They serve similar purposes in their respective domains – determining the degree of parallelism – but in modern Spark you’ll often adjust `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` since most work is in DataFrames. You can set these in the Spark config (e.g., via `SparkConf` or `spark-submit --conf` or `spark.conf.set(...)` at runtime).

### Automatic Partitioning for File-Based Data Sources (Parquet, CSV, etc.)
When reading data from files (like Parquet or CSV), Spark will automatically determine the number of partitions (and thus parallel tasks) based on the file sizes and the cluster’s parallelism. Spark uses **Hadoop InputFormats** under the hood (for CSV, JSON, text) and its own optimizations (for Parquet) to split files into chunks. By default, each file is split into chunks of at most **`spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes`** (128 MB by default). However, Spark also avoids creating too many tiny partitions by grouping small files together using an **open cost** heuristic.

Spark’s partitioning formula for files is roughly as follows:
1. **Calculate total input size** (`TotalBytes`), which is the sum of file sizes plus a fixed overhead per file (from `spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes`, default 4 MB per file). The open cost is an estimation of the cost to open and read each file – Spark treats that as equivalent to reading an extra 4 MB per file to account for seek time and metadata overhead.
2. **Compute an initial partition sizing** by dividing `TotalBytes` by the default parallelism (`spark.default.parallelism`) to get `BytesPerCore`. The idea is to distribute the data roughly evenly among the parallel tasks available by default.
3. **Set `maxSplitBytes`** as the minimum of the default max partition size (128 MB) and the larger of `BytesPerCore` and the open cost. This ensures partitions are not too large (capped at 128 MB by default) and not too small (at least one `BytesPerCore` chunk, unless the file is tiny).
4. **Estimate number of partitions** as `TotalBytes / maxSplitBytes`. Spark will create that many partitions (tasks) to read the data.

For example, suppose you have a single 64 MB CSV file and 8 cores in your environment. Spark’s default parallelism might be 8. If `TotalBytes = 64 MB + openCost (4 MB) = 68 MB`, then `BytesPerCore = 68 MB / 8 = 8.5 MB` (approx). The `maxSplitBytes` will be the minimum of 128 MB and `max(4 MB, 8.5 MB)` which is 8.5 MB. So Spark will divide 68 MB by ~8.5 MB and come up with about 8 partitions. Indeed, a Stack Overflow example observed **8 partitions for a ~96 MB CSV file on an 8-core local cluster**, following this logic. Each partition will read roughly 8–12 MB of the file. If you had many small files, Spark would count each file’s 4 MB open cost, which encourages grouping multiple small files into one partition to avoid a tiny partition per file.

**Parquet files** work similarly, though Parquet has internal row groups. Spark’s planning for Parquet will ignore the number of row groups and instead use the above size-based calculation to decide initial tasks. For instance, one user had three Parquet files totaling ~522 MB; with 8 cores, Spark computed ~9 tasks, splitting the largest file into 6 tasks and the others into 1 and 2 tasks respectively. Importantly, Spark did this *without* reading Parquet footers or metadata extensively – it’s based on file sizes and the default parallelism. If you increase `spark.default.parallelism`, Spark will plan more, smaller partitions for the same input data. In the Parquet example, raising `spark.default.parallelism` to 30 caused Spark to create 30 tasks for the same files, meaning each partition was much smaller (around 17 MB each in that test).

**CSV and text files** use HDFS block boundaries and the same formula for combining splits. By default, if a file exceeds the HDFS block size (typically 128 MB), it will be split into multiple partitions of roughly block size ([RDD Programming Guide - Spark 3.5.5 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#:~:text=,have%20fewer%20partitions%20than%20blocks)). If you have many small files, Spark’s open cost mechanism will try to pack several files into one partition (to avoid the “small files problem”). You can control some of this behavior with settings like `spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes` (default 4MB) and `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` (default 128MB). There’s also `spark.sql.files.minPartitionNum` which if set will ensure at least that many partitions (overriding the formula’s lower bound); if not set, Spark uses `spark.default.parallelism` as a floor for partitions when splitting files. This means on a large cluster, Spark won’t create fewer partitions than the default parallelism, even if the files are small, ensuring the cluster’s CPUs are utilized.

**Example – Reading a CSV:** Consider code like: 

```python
df = spark.read.csv("/path/to/large_dataset.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
print(df.rdd.getNumPartitions())
``` 

If `large_dataset.csv` is 1 GB and you’re on a cluster with 8 cores, Spark might split it into ~8 tasks by default (each ~128 MB) because of the logic above. If instead you have 1000 small CSV files of 1 MB each, Spark will not launch 1000 tasks. It will group them, perhaps ending up with on the order of `totalSize / 128MB` or `spark.default.parallelism` tasks, whichever is larger. You might see, for example, 8 or 16 tasks rather than 1000, because Spark groups several of those small files per partition (each partition can read multiple files).

**Example – Reading Parquet:** If you do: 

```python
df = spark.read.parquet("/data/events/")
print(df.rdd.getNumPartitions())
``` 

Spark will list the Parquet files in the directory and apply the same size-based bin-packing. Let’s say `/data/events/` contains 50 Parquet files of 10 MB each (total 500 MB). If running on a cluster with 8 cores, `spark.default.parallelism` ~ 8, Spark might aim for ~8 tasks. It will add the open cost (4MB * 50 files = 200 MB overhead) to total size (500+200=700 MB), divide by 8 (≈87.5 MB per core), cap at 128 MB. The max split size becomes ~87.5 MB (since that’s less than 128). Then tasks = 700/87.5 = 8 tasks. Each task will handle roughly 6–7 of the Parquet files. In practice, you’d see ~8 partitions in `df.rdd.getNumPartitions()`. If instead you had a few very large Parquet files, each could be split into multiple tasks (one per ~128MB chunk) to increase parallelism.

### Automatic Partitioning for RDDs (Parallelize and TextFile)
When you create RDDs directly, Spark also infers a partition count:
- **`sc.parallelize()`**: This creates an RDD from an in-memory collection. If you don’t specify a number of partitions, it uses `spark.default.parallelism` by default ([performance - What is the difference between spark.sql.shuffle.partitions and spark.default.parallelism? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45704156/what-is-the-difference-between-spark-sql-shuffle-partitions-and-spark-default-pa#:~:text=,In%20DataSourceScanExec%27s)). For example, on a cluster with 16 cores total, `sc.parallelize(data)` will cut the data into 16 partitions by default. You can override this by passing a second argument: e.g., `sc.parallelize(data, 100)` would make 100 partitions.
- **`sc.textFile()`**: This reads a text file (or directory of text files) into an RDD of lines. By default it will create one partition per HDFS block of the file ([RDD Programming Guide - Spark 3.5.5 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#:~:text=,have%20fewer%20partitions%20than%20blocks)). If reading from a local file system in local mode, it may default to one partition per file (unless the file is large enough to split). You can optionally pass a minPartitions argument to `textFile`. For example, `sc.textFile("hdfs:///path/to/data.txt", minPartitions=40)` will try to create 40 partitions even if the file has fewer blocks (Spark will split blocks further to meet this number, but it won’t go below the natural block count) ([RDD Programming Guide - Spark 3.5.5 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#:~:text=,have%20fewer%20partitions%20than%20blocks)). Without specifying, `textFile` on a large file uses block count (so a 1GB file on HDFS with 128MB blocks -> 8 partitions). On many small files, each file may count as at least one partition unless small files are in the same directory (Spark can combine them if you wildcard a directory, using `wholeTextFiles` for example, but typically each file is one partition in RDD API unless you manually coalesce later).
  
**Example:** Running in local mode with 4 cores, `sc.parallelize(range(1000))` will produce 4 partitions by default (each ~250 numbers). In cluster mode with 8 executors * 4 cores each (32 cores), the same call would produce 32 partitions by default. Similarly, `sc.textFile("/logs/2025/03/*.log")` might create one partition per log file if each is small, but if you know you have hundreds of tiny log files, you could specify a lower `minPartitions` to avoid too many tasks, or afterwards call `.coalesce()` to reduce the number of partitions.

### Partitioning Data from Databases (JDBC Sources)
When Spark reads from an external database via JDBC (e.g., SQL Server or Oracle), the default behavior is to pull all data in a **single partition** (single JDBC connection). **By default, Spark will use one task to read the entire table or query result**. This means no parallelism during the read – one executor (and one database connection) will fetch all the data sequentially. For small tables this is fine, but for large tables it’s a performance bottleneck.

To enable parallel reads from a JDBC source, Spark provides options:
- **`partitionColumn`**, `lowerBound`, `upperBound`, and `numPartitions`: These options instruct Spark to split the SQL query on the given numeric column’s range. Spark will generate queries like `SELECT ... FROM table WHERE partitionColumn BETWEEN lowerBound AND upperBound` split into multiple ranges. For example, if `partitionColumn = "id"`, `lowerBound = 1`, `upperBound = 10000`, `numPartitions = 4`, Spark will internally create 4 queries: roughly `id BETWEEN 1 and 2500`, `id BETWEEN 2501 and 5000`, etc., each query executed by a separate Spark task/connection. The resulting DataFrame will have 4 partitions. You should choose a partitionColumn that evenly splits the data (often a primary key or a date column), and set bounds such that partitions are balanced.

**Important:** If you do not specify `numPartitions` and related options, **Spark’s JDBC reader will use a single partition**. This can be verified by checking `df.rdd.getNumPartitions()` after a JDBC load – it will be 1 unless partitioning is configured. So for large tables, always consider adding partitioning options.

**Example – JDBC parallel read:** 

```python
jdbc_url = "jdbc:sqlserver://host:1433;databaseName=mydb"
df = spark.read.format("jdbc") \
    .option("url", jdbc_url) \
    .option("dbtable", "dbo.LargeTable") \
    .option("user", "spark_user").option("password", "secret") \
    .option("driver", "com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver") \
    .option("partitionColumn", "id") \
    .option("lowerBound", "1") \
    .option("upperBound", "1000000") \
    .option("numPartitions", "10") \
    .load()
print(df.rdd.getNumPartitions())  # Expected: 10
```

In this example, Spark will create 10 parallel tasks to read the table `LargeTable`, each fetching an approximately equal range of `id` values (assuming `id` 1 to 1,000,000 spread evenly). Each task will open its own JDBC connection. The result is that the DataFrame is built from 10 partitions in parallel, greatly increasing throughput compared to a single partition read. If the data is skewed (some ranges have more rows), the partitioning might not be perfectly equal, but it’s often a huge improvement.

For Oracle, a common trick is to use a numeric pseudo-column or an evenly distributed column for partitioning. For example, using an Oracle query as the source with a modulus on a primary key could simulate partitioning, but the standard way is still numeric ranges on a column. Note that for databases, Spark cannot automatically infer parallel partitioning; you must specify it. If the database table is small, you might leave it as 1 partition and later use `repartition()` in Spark if needed, but ideally push parallelism to the source to minimize data transfer time.

### Spark SQL Queries vs. DataFrames 
If you run a SQL query through Spark (using `spark.sql()` on a temporary view or Hive table), the partitioning of the result will depend on the operations in the query. If it’s a simple SELECT from a file-based table, it will use the file source partitioning logic above. If it involves joins or aggregations, the final number of partitions will typically be `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` (unless adjusted). For example:

```python
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 50)
df = spark.sql("SELECT col1, count(*) FROM table GROUP BY col1")
```

Here the result of the aggregation will have 50 partitions because of our shuffle partitions setting. If we hadn’t set it, it would default to 200 partitions for the shuffle stage. This holds whether you use the DataFrame API (`df.groupBy("col1").count()`) or a SQL string – both use the same underlying execution engine. 

One key difference: **Spark SQL (with JDBC)** – If you use Spark to query an external database *through JDBC* by using an SQL query (with `.option("query", "...")` instead of `dbtable`), it still follows the same partitioning rules as the plain `dbtable` option. By default, one partition, unless you also provide partitioning options.

## How Partitions Impact Performance 
The way data is partitioned can make or break Spark application performance. Key points to consider:

- **One Task per Partition:** Spark schedules one task for each partition in a stage. Each task is executed by one core. If you have **fewer partitions than available cores**, some cores will sit idle for that stage, and you won’t fully utilize the CPU parallelism. For example, if you have a 16-core cluster but only 8 partitions, at most 8 cores can work at a time on that data – effectively you’re using only half the parallel capacity. This typically leads to longer execution time.

- **Too Many Partitions:** While generally more partitions (up to a point) means more parallel tasks and potentially faster processing, having **too many partitions** can introduce overhead. There is a per-task overhead for scheduling and task management. If partitions are extremely small (say each task only processes a few KB of data), the scheduling overhead and coordination might dominate the actual computation. For instance, 10,000 tiny partitions might be less efficient than 1,000 slightly larger partitions. Moreover, if you produce too many output partitions, you may end up with a very large number of small files on disk, which can hurt downstream reading performance and strain file systems (especially object stores or HDFS NameNode with many files). 

- **Partition Size:** Each partition’s data is processed in memory by an executor core. If a partition is too large (e.g., hundreds of MB or several GB), it could cause that task to run very slowly or even run out of memory. A common guideline is to aim for partition sizes of at most 100–200 MB of data in memory (after serialization) per partition for comfortable processing, though this can vary. The default 128 MB split size is a general heuristic. If you notice tasks spilling to disk or running long due to huge data per task, you might need to increase the number of partitions.

- **Balanced vs Skewed Partitions:** Ideally, work is evenly distributed. If one partition has significantly more data or processing than others (data skew), that task will become the straggler that slows down the whole stage. This can happen if data is skewed by key in a shuffle (one key has many records ending up in one partition after a groupBy or join). In such cases, you might need to repartition differently or handle the skew (e.g., add a salt to the key, or use techniques like `salting` or the adaptive execution which can split skewed partitions). In normal operation, **repartitioning by a key** will try to evenly hash-distribute data across partitions. But if one key is extremely hot, even hash distribution can’t fix that without special handling. The main thing is to monitor in the Spark UI: if you see one task taking much longer or having much more data, that indicates an imbalance.

- **Recommended number of partitions:** The Spark documentation suggests aiming for **2–4 partitions per CPU core in your cluster** ([RDD Programming Guide - Spark 3.5.5 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#:~:text=One%20important%20parameter%20for%20parallel,to%20maintain%20backward%20compatibility)) ([RDD Programming Guide - Spark 3.5.5 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#:~:text=Typically%20you%20want%202,some%20places%20in%20the%20code)). This rule of thumb allows some flexibility and overlap in execution. For example, with 16 cores, you might have 32–64 partitions in a large RDD. This isn’t a hard rule, but it often gives good parallelism without tiny tasks. The rationale is to allow each core to process multiple tasks over the course of the stage (helping load balance small variations in task lengths). If each core only ever gets 1 task (equal partitions to cores), then if one core’s task finishes quickly, it has nothing else to do while others are still working – having a few extra partitions can even that out. On the other hand, setting partitions to an extreme like 10x or 100x the number of cores can lead to a lot of overhead (unless using adaptive scheduling or partition coalescing at runtime). 

- **Memory and Shuffle Considerations:** During shuffles, data is exchanged between partitions. The number of partitions in a shuffle (`spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` or specified by you) determines how many shuffle files and network transfers happen. More partitions = more (smaller) shuffle blocks, fewer partitions = fewer (bigger) shuffle blocks. Too many can overwhelm the shuffle service with tiny files; too few can cause heavy data transfer to a single reducer. It’s about finding a balance.

To illustrate impact, suppose you have a large dataset and you filter it down to a much smaller dataset. If the original had 1,000 partitions and after filtering it’s only a few thousand rows total, those 1,000 partitions now mostly contain no data or very little data. If you then perform an expensive operation on the filtered data (say a join with another small dataset), Spark will still launch 1,000 tasks, many of which do almost nothing. The extra overhead could be significant relative to the work. In such a case, you’d benefit from reducing the number of partitions after the filter (using `coalesce()` or `repartition()`) to, say, 100 or even fewer. Conversely, if you have a single huge partition and you need to leverage all executors to process it, you’d want to increase partitions so that multiple tasks can work on chunks of that data concurrently. 

The bottom line: **well-tuned partitions** ensure each executor core is doing a reasonable amount of work without long stragglers or excessive overhead. It can dramatically speed up processing. Monitoring Spark’s UI (Tasks and Stages pages) is useful – look at the “Tasks” table to see data size per task and task duration. If you see tasks processing 500MB each and running long, maybe increase partitions. If you see thousands of tasks each processing 100KB, consider reducing partitions for that stage.

## Repartition vs. Coalesce: Changing the Number of Partitions
Spark provides two primary transformations to change an existing RDD/DataFrame’s partition count:
- **`repartition()`** – either increases or decreases partitions, **by performing a full shuffle** of the data.
- **`coalesce()`** – mainly used to **decrease** the number of partitions (you can’t ask it to increase partitions without a shuffle), and tries to avoid a full shuffle by moving data into fewer partitions in a more streamlined way.

Understanding the difference and when to use each is crucial for performance tuning.

### Repartition – Full Shuffle for Even Distribution
`DataFrame.repartition(numPartitions)` (or RDD’s `repartition`) will create a new distribution of data across the specified number of partitions, involving a shuffle of all data. When you call repartition, Spark will produce a **shuffle stage**: it will take each existing partition, break it into **numPartitions** chunks, and send each chunk to the appropriate new partition. By default, this is a hash partition (for DataFrames, essentially random or based on hash of data unless you specify a column). The end result is typically **evenly sized partitions** (or as evenly as the hash function can manage). Because it’s a full data shuffle, repartition can both *increase* the number of partitions or *decrease* it. If you decrease, it behaves like a heavy-weight way to coalesce; if you increase, it’s the only way (since coalesce won’t increase).

**Impact on performance:** Repartition is an expensive operation because all data is exchanged over the network (unless by chance data was already hash-partitioned ideally). However, it ensures that the data is evenly balanced, which can be very important for performance in later stages. If you have a situation with skewed partitions or a need for more parallelism, `repartition()` is the tool to use. Also, repartition can repartition by a **column** or expression: `df.repartition(col("key"))` will hash-partition the DataFrame on the values of `key` column, so that all rows with the same key go to the same partition (like using a partitioner on an RDD). This is useful before a join: if two DataFrames are repartitioned by the join key to the same number of partitions, the join can be performed without an additional shuffle because data with the same key co-resides in the same partition on each side.

**Example:** Suppose you have a DataFrame with 10 partitions but you want to write it out as 40 files to better use a 40-core cluster. You can do `df = df.repartition(40)` and then `df.write.parquet(...)`. This will incur a shuffle, redistributing the data into 40 new partitions, and then 40 tasks will write 40 files in parallel. Each of the 40 output files should be of roughly equal size if the data was evenly distributed. If instead you had 1000 partitions of very uneven sizes and you call `repartition(40)`, Spark will still do a full shuffle but should result in 40 balanced partitions, solving any skew from the previous partitioning. Keep in mind that repartition’s shuffle cost might be worthwhile if it prevents an even costlier skew or single-threaded operation later.

Spark’s `repartition()` is essentially a convenient way to do `coalesce(n, shuffle=true)` in the RDD API. In fact, under the hood **`DataFrame.repartition` is equivalent to RDD `coalesce(..., shuffle=true)`**, meaning it always shuffles. There is also `repartition(numPartitions, col1, col2, ...)` which partitions the data by hash of specified column(s) (and defaults to `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` if you only specify columns without a number). For example, `df.repartition($"category")` might result in 200 partitions (default) hashed by category, whereas `df.repartition(10, $"category")` gives you exactly 10 partitions by category value.

### Coalesce – Narrow Dependency (Mostly for Decrease)
`DataFrame.coalesce(numPartitions)` will **reduce** the number of partitions without a full shuffle. Coalesce works by **combining existing partitions** into fewer partitions. It’s a *narrow transformation*, meaning each new partition is made up of one or more whole **existing** partitions’ data, and no data from one original partition goes to two different target partitions. Because of this, coalesce avoids the cost of redistributing all data, but it cannot make **more** partitions than you started with (if you request more, it simply retains the original count). In practice, coalesce is used to collapse the number of partitions when you know that current partitions are too many and mostly empty or too fine-grained.

How does coalesce avoid shuffle? Imagine you have 4 partitions and you coalesce to 2. Spark can do this by **assigning two input partitions to each new partition**. For instance, new partition0 will consist of old partition0 + old partition1, and new partition1 will consist of old partition2 + old partition3. It will try to keep the data on the same nodes – if partition0 and partition1 were on the same executor, their union can be done locally without network transfer. If not, Spark may still need to move some data, but it tries to minimize it. There is no sorting or hash partitioning involved; it’s more like a concatenation of partitions. This is why coalescing is much more efficient when reducing partitions (especially if the data is already on a few nodes and you’re reducing to that few).

However, **coalescing can lead to imbalanced partition sizes**. Since it doesn’t do sophisticated rebalancing, one partition might end up significantly larger than another if the original distribution was uneven. For example, if you had partitions of sizes [5MB, 500MB, 5MB, 5MB] and you coalesce from 4 to 2, you might end up with [505MB, 10MB] across the two new partitions. One will take much longer to process. Repartitioning to 2 would instead likely give you ~257.5MB and ~257.5MB (balanced) because it redistributes data.

**Coalesce cannot increase partitions** unless you use the RDD API with shuffle enabled. In the DataFrame API, if you call `df.coalesce(100)` but `df` currently has 10 partitions, you will still have 10 partitions after coalesce (Spark will log or silently ignore the request to increase). Coalesce is strictly for collapsing partitions. If you need to *increase* the number of partitions, you must use `repartition()`.

**When to use coalesce:** It’s ideal when you have *way too many partitions* and need to trim them down with minimal cost. A common use case is after reading data from a cluster with many small files or after a wide operation that left a large number of partitions that are only sparsely filled. Another use case is just before writing out a result, to reduce the number of output files. Coalesce is also used in iterative algorithms when the dataset shrinks dramatically in later stages and you want to avoid keeping a high partition count.

**Drastic coalescing:** One caution from the Spark documentation – if you coalesce down to a very small number (like 1) it could make your job run slower because it puts all the work on one node or a few nodes. E.g., `df.coalesce(1)` will produce a single partition, which means a single task, which can only run on one core of one executor. If the dataset is large, you just forced the entire workload onto one CPU. Spark’s docs note that if you truly need a single partition, you might be better off using `repartition(1)` in some cases to let Spark shuffle and parallelize the upstream computation, then end up with one partition at the end. In other words, coalesce(1) is only efficient if the data is already small or largely on one node; repartition(1) ensures the data is aggregated through a shuffle but multiple nodes can contribute to that shuffle.

**Example:** Imagine you have a DataFrame with 1000 partitions after reading a large dataset (perhaps each file became a partition). You apply a filter that retains only a small portion of the data. Now you have 1000 almost-empty partitions. If you write this out, you’ll get 1000 tiny files – inefficient. You can do `df_small = df_large.filter(...).coalesce(10)` to reduce to 10 partitions. This does not shuffle the data (each of the 10 new partitions will just grab ~100 of the old ones). Now writing `df_small` will produce 10 files. The coalesce operation is relatively cheap since it didn’t have to send all data through a network shuffle – it only moved data where needed to bundle partitions together. If one of those 10 ends up bigger than others, you might not care if overall size is small, or you might have chosen 10 specifically to get a comfortable size per partition.

### Side-by-Side Comparison 
**Data Movement:** Repartition **shuffles** all data across the network (each record likely moves to a new partition) while Coalesce tries to **minimize data movement** by avoiding shuffling between partitions. Coalesce may still move entire partitions between executors if it needs to consolidate to fewer nodes, but it won’t split partitions. Repartition will fragment and redistribute everything, ensuring even distribution.

**Ability to Increase Partitions:** Repartition can increase or decrease the number of partitions arbitrarily. Coalesce can only decrease (without shuffle).

**Resulting Partition Sizes:** Coalesce may result in **uneven partition sizes** (some big, some small) because it just glues partitions together. Repartition aims for **roughly equal-sized partitions** because the hash shuffle spreads records evenly by key (or random) across the new partitions.

**Speed:** In scenarios where you’re reducing partitions moderately and data is already spread out, coalesce can be faster since it avoids the cost of shuffle. But if coalesce leads to one partition becoming a hotspot, the subsequent operations on that partition could be slow. Repartition is slower upfront (because of the shuffle) but can make downstream operations faster by balancing the data.

A common Spark tip: *try coalesce first when reducing partitions, but if you see imbalance or performance issues, use repartition*. In fact, you might see advice that **coalesce is generally used to *decrease* partitions, and repartition to *increase* partitions** (or to evenly rebalance). If you call `repartition(n)` with fewer partitions to more, it’s straightforward shuffle. If you call `repartition(n)` with n less than current, it’s essentially the same as calling `coalesce(n)` with shuffle = true (so an even redistribution). 

**Under the hood:** In RDD API, `rdd.coalesce(n, shuffle=False)` will do the narrow coalesce, and `rdd.coalesce(n, shuffle=True)` will actually shuffle (behaving like repartition). `rdd.repartition(n)` is literally implemented as `coalesce(n, shuffle=true)`. The Dataset/DataFrame API hides this shuffle parameter, so `df.coalesce(n)` is always shuffle=False behavior, and `df.repartition(n)` is always shuffle (unless n is equal to current partitions, in which case nothing changes).

### Examples to Illustrate 
Consider a simple RDD of numbers 1 through 12, partitioned into 4 partitions initially:
```
Partition 0: [1,2,3]
Partition 1: [4,5,6]
Partition 2: [7,8,9]
Partition 3: [10,11,12]
```
If we call `coalesce(2)` on this RDD, Spark will try to merge these 4 partitions into 2. A possible outcome (without shuffle) is:
```
New Partition 0: [1,2,3] + [4,5,6]   (merging old partitions 0 and 1)
New Partition 1: [7,8,9] + [10,11,12]   (merging old partitions 2 and 3)
```
So we end up with 2 partitions: one containing 1–6 and the other 7–12. There was no fine-grained redistribution, just concatenation of partitions. If the original partitions were on different nodes, whole partitions [4,5,6] might have moved to the node holding [1,2,3] (or vice versa) so that the new Partition 0 is on one executor. But importantly, records from partition0 didn’t go to multiple places; they stayed intact.

If we call `repartition(2)` on the original 4-partition RDD instead, Spark will perform a hash shuffle. The result might look like:
```
New Partition 0: [1,4,7,10,11]  (roughly half the data, mixed from all old partitions)
New Partition 1: [2,3,5,6,8,9,12]  (the other half)
```
(This distribution is not exact, it's conceptual – actual distribution depends on hash values of the data.) The key point is each new partition has some data from each of the original ones. The data was fully shuffled to try to equalize lengths (here one partition got 5 elements, the other 7; in a real hash of 12 numbers maybe you'd get 6 and 6). This involved more data movement but now each partition has a mix of data that is more evenly sized (no partition holding 6 elements vs another holding 0; they’re close).

On a cluster, the coalesce example might end up using only 2 executors (because only two partitions of work remain), whereas the repartition example will still use all executors for the shuffle and could assign the 2 resulting partitions to 2 executors (possibly different ones than in coalesce, but effectively also using 2 executors for final tasks – though all participated in the shuffle stage). The difference is upstream: the repartition allowed 4 tasks (on 4 executors) to participate in the shuffle to create 2 partitions, whereas coalesce likely ran only 2 tasks (taking data from others as needed). In general, **repartition allows parallelism in the shuffle stage equal to the original number of partitions, whereas coalesce just maps old partitions to new with possibly fewer concurrent tasks**. This is why sometimes repartition can outperform coalesce when collapsing partitions: repartition(1) will use many cores to shuffle data into one partition, coalesce(1) will use a single core (one task) to gather everything.

### When to Use Repartition vs Coalesce 
- Use **`coalesce()`** when you **want to decrease the number of partitions** and you suspect the current partitions are already fairly distributed (or you don’t care about slight imbalance) and you want to avoid the cost of a full shuffle. Common scenarios:
  - After a filter that greatly reduced the data, coalesce to bring down the task count.
  - Before writing output to disk, to avoid generating too many small files.
  - When merging many small partitions into fewer larger ones for efficiency.
  - In iterative algorithms, to reduce overhead in later iterations once data size shrinks.
  
  Coalesce is a good choice if the next stage of computation doesn’t require perfect balance. For example, if you are just writing to disk or performing a simple map operation next, an imbalance might not be critical.

- Use **`repartition()`** when you **need to increase partitions**, or when going to fewer partitions but you require a more even spread of data (or need to utilize all cores in the process of resizing partitions). Scenarios:
  - Before a heavy operation (like a join or aggregation), if your data is in one or few partitions and you need to parallelize it. E.g., reading from JDBC gave 1 partition – you might do `repartition(<<cores*2>>)` to distribute it before processing.
  - When combining datasets that have different partition counts or keys, to align them. E.g., repartition both DataFrames on the join key to have the same number of partitions each (and possibly the same partitioning strategy) for an efficient join.
  - After a stage that caused severe skew or imbalance, to redistribute data evenly again.
  - When you reduce partitions *drastically*. If you go from 1000 partitions to 10, coalesce might put 900 of those into a single partition and 9 hold the rest, which is bad. Repartition(10) will shuffle for 10 roughly equal ones. If you go from 1000 to 800 or 500, coalesce would probably be okay if data was uniform; but 1000 to 10 is safer with repartition.
  - If you truly need to minimize data movement but coalesce is not giving a good balance, you can actually call `coalesce(n)` with `shuffle=true` in the RDD API (or simply `repartition(n)` in DataFrame API) – it will shuffle but try to keep a balance.

**Note:** Spark’s Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) can automatically coalesce shuffle partitions at runtime for you in Spark 3+, which sometimes renders manual tuning less important for the final shuffle stages. But AQE primarily works on shuffle stages, not initial file reads or user-called coalesce/repartition on RDDs.

### Coalesce and Repartition with RDD vs DataFrame 
The concepts are the same for RDDs and DataFrames, but the APIs differ slightly:
- **RDD.coalesce(numPartitions, shuffle=False)**: Narrow coalesce (no shuffle) as described. If you set shuffle=True, it will do a shuffle allowing increase.
- **RDD.repartition(numPartitions)**: Convenience that does `coalesce(numPartitions, shuffle=True)` internally.
- **DataFrame.coalesce(numPartitions)**: Narrow coalesce only. Cannot increase partitions (the docs explicitly state if you ask for more it will stay at current count).
- **DataFrame.repartition(numPartitions)**: Always shuffles. You can also do `df.repartition(n, $"col")` to shuffle partition by a column’s hash. If no numPartitions given and just columns, it uses the default 200 (or whatever `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` is set to).
- **DataFrame.repartitionByRange(...)**: Another variant that shuffles but organizes data by range of a column (often used for range join optimization or for writing data sorted by something). Not asked here, but just to note it exists.

One more subtle difference: Because `coalesce` is a narrow transformation, if you do `df2 = df.coalesce(1)` and then perform further operations on `df2`, Spark may be able to **pipeline** those in one stage (since no shuffle boundary). But if you do `df2 = df.repartition(1)`, that introduces a shuffle boundary – subsequent operations will be another stage. This can affect how you structure computations (though usually you coalesce/repartition near the end or explicitly for a reason, not just randomly in the middle).

### Impact on Query Execution Plans
If you look at Spark execution plans or the Spark UI:
- A `repartition` will show up as an **Exchange** (shuffle) in the physical plan. For DataFrames, it might say “Exchange hashpartitioning” or similar, indicating a shuffle occurred to redistribute data.
- A `coalesce` (narrow) will not show an Exchange. Instead, it might just adjust the partitioning in place. In the UI, you might simply see fewer tasks in the following stage, but no separate shuffle stage for the coalesce itself.

Using `coalesce` in the middle of a plan can reduce parallelism for subsequent operations because it lowers the number of partitions without a shuffle. For example, if you coalesce down to 1 partition and then do a `map` and then a `filter`, Spark will run that entire sequence in a single task (one partition) – obviously not utilizing the cluster. So you should typically coalesce *after* the heavy lifting (or when you know the dataset is small enough that parallelism isn’t beneficial). On the contrary, using `repartition` in the middle will incur a cost immediately (to shuffle), but then you might benefit in the next operation if it was bottlenecked by a low number of partitions.

### Example Use Cases:
- **After a join, reduce partitions for output:** Two big DataFrames join, resulting in 200 partitions (default). If you plan to write the result to a single file (say a report), you might do `result.coalesce(1).write.csv(...)`. If the result is still very large, consider `repartition(1)` instead to leverage parallelism in writing (the shuffle will bring data together but many nodes can send data to the one output partition).
- **After filtering a huge dataset:** Suppose a job reads 100GB of data into 800 partitions, then filters 99% of it, ending up with 1GB of data. Initially 800 partitions might be overkill for 1GB (each now ~1.25 MB). You can do `filtered = huge_df.filter(...).coalesce(50)` to end up with 50 partitions (~20MB each). This avoids running subsequent computations on 800 tiny tasks or writing 800 small files.
- **Repartition before join:** If you have two DataFrames you know are going to join on a key and one is much larger than the other, sometimes you repartition the larger one by the join key (to, say, 1000 partitions) and also repartition the smaller one by the same key and number of partitions. This ensures the shuffle join is optimally parallel and balanced (Spark would do a shuffle anyway, but you control the partition count to perhaps match your cluster cores, and maybe reduce skew if one side was skewed differently). You can also use the **broadcast join** strategy for a small table, but that’s another topic.
- **Dynamic coalesce with AQE:** Spark 3’s AQE can automatically coalesce shuffle partitions. For example, if you left `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=200` but the data volume after a shuffle is small, AQE might combine those 200 into, say, 50 at runtime. This is as if it did a coalesce on the shuffle RDD. This helps avoid manual coalesce in some cases. But AQE won’t coalesce partitions of a DataFrame read or an RDD – it’s only for shuffles.

Now that we understand these mechanisms, let’s see how they apply to different data sources and scenarios.

## Partitions in Parquet, CSV, and SQL Source Workloads
Different data sources and operations can benefit from explicit repartitioning or coalescing:

### Parquet and CSV Files 
When reading from **Parquet** or **CSV**, Spark already creates partitions based on file splits as described. Usually, you do not need to manually repartition right after reading unless:
- You want to increase parallelism beyond what the splitting gave (e.g., one huge file was read into 8 partitions but you have 50 cores idle – you might do `df = df.repartition(50)` to split it further; though a better approach is usually to increase `spark.default.parallelism` or use `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` to influence the initial split).
- You find that after reading, you have too many partitions (lots of tiny tasks). This can happen if you had an extremely large number of small files and Spark honored `spark.default.parallelism` which is high. For instance, on a cluster with 100 cores, defaultParallelism=100, even a moderately sized dataset could be split into 100 tasks. If each task ends up reading, say, 1 MB, that might be inefficient. You could `coalesce(20)` to reduce to 20 partitions.

**Example:** Reading 1000 small gzipped CSV files might result in 1000 partitions (since compressed files often can’t be split and each file is one partition). If each file is 1MB, then 1000 tasks will each handle 1MB – quite a lot of overhead. Here, doing `df = spark.read.csv(...).coalesce(100)` could merge 10 files per partition (roughly) to have 100 partitions total. That’s far fewer tasks to schedule and larger contiguous reads per task (maybe 10MB each), which is generally more efficient. Coalescing is fine here because we’re just gluing partitions together and there’s no need to redistribute contents across partitions; we just want fewer of them.

After transformations, if you perform a shuffle (join, groupBy, etc.), the resulting DataFrame will default to 200 partitions (or whatever `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` is). This might be independent of how many input splits you had. For example, you read a CSV into 50 partitions, then do a `df.groupBy("category").count()`. The aggregation will output 200 partitions by default, not 50. If 200 is not appropriate, you have options: set `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` to a better number (perhaps equal to number of cores or something) *before* the operation, or explicitly call `.repartition(n)` or `.coalesce(n)` on the result. 

For writing to disk, consider the target file system: if it’s HDFS, writing many small files (hundreds or thousands) can later burden the NameNode and make reading slow (lots of seeking). If it’s cloud storage (S3, ADLS), many small files means many GET requests for readers and overhead. So you often want to reduce file count. Parquet itself likes larger files (because of footer metadata and row group overhead). So it’s a good practice to write out Parquet files maybe 100MB – 1GB each rather than 10KB each. That means tuning the number of partitions just before the write to achieve that file size. You can estimate: **desired number of output files = total data size / target file size**. If you know your output DataFrame is ~10 GB and you want ~128 MB files, you’d aim for about 80 files. If your output DataFrame currently has 200 partitions, you might coalesce to 80. If it has 10 partitions (each ~1 GB), you might repartition to 80 (since coalesce can’t increase from 10 to 80 without shuffle).

**Example:** `resultDF.coalesce(1).write.parquet("/output/path")`. This will produce exactly 1 Parquet file (plus a small `_SUCCESS` file). Use this if you explicitly need a single file output (common when generating small reference data or just to simplify downstream consumption). But be aware: if `resultDF` is large, this single task could be a bottleneck. Sometimes it's okay because resultDF is small anyway, other times it's a problem.

**Example:** `wideDF.repartition(100).write.csv("/out/path")`. If `wideDF` was huge and had default 200 partitions, this actually *increases* parallelism of the write stage to 100 tasks (down from 200, so in this case we *decreased* partitions using repartition which is unusual – probably we would more often increase or keep same). But suppose we know our cluster has 100 cores and 200 was overkill; writing with 100 tasks could reduce overhead and still keep all cores busy (assuming 1 core per task). In most cases, though, you would either stick with 200 or choose a number based on file size as described.

One particular scenario: **Many small files problem**. It’s common enough that people use coalesce or repartition to combat it. If you have thousands of small input files, Spark can end up with as many partitions. Reading them is fine (Spark will handle it, albeit with many tasks), but writing out results could also result in many small files (especially if each input file was processed independently). A best practice is to coalesce before writing to combine those results. If each input file corresponded to some partition of output, use coalesce to bring them together. Another approach is using `df.repartitionByRange()` or `df.repartition(n, monotonically_increasing_id())` to do a round-robin shuffle of data before writing, effectively merging outputs. But a simpler is often `coalesce`.

### JDBC (SQL Server, Oracle, etc.) Sources
As mentioned, by default reading from a JDBC source gives one partition (one task). That means one core is pulling all the data, and your cluster might be mostly idle during that time. If you find that you have a large table, always try to use the partitioning options:
```python
spark.read.jdbc(url, table="schema.table", column="id", lowerBound=1, upperBound=1000000, numPartitions=16, properties=...)
``` 
This will create 16 parallel tasks (assuming the column `id` is evenly distributed 1 through 1,000,000). Each partition will get ~1/16th of the rows. This is hugely faster for big tables because it uses multiple JDBC connections in parallel. The difference can be dramatic (linear with number of partitions up to the DB and network’s capability).

If you cannot find a suitable numeric column for partitioning (e.g., no single column covers all rows evenly), sometimes people use a trick: run a query that adds a row number or something. Some databases allow `MOD` on a primary key or use an analytic function to split data. For example:
```python
df = spark.read.jdbc(
    url, 
    query="(SELECT *, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY <primary_key>) AS part FROM myTable) t", 
    lowerBound=1, upperBound=4, numPartitions=4, partitionColumn="part", properties=...
)
``` 
This requires the database to support those analytics (e.g., Oracle or SQL Server can do window functions or NTILE to create 4 buckets). Spark then runs 4 queries for part=1,2,3,4. This is advanced usage though. If such tricks are not available, and you’re stuck with one partition from the DB, you can always repartition *after* reading into Spark. For example:
```python
df_single = spark.read.jdbc(url, table="bigTable", properties=...)
df = df_single.repartition(sc.defaultParallelism)
``` 
This will at least distribute the data in Spark so subsequent operations use all cores. But note: the read from DB is still single-threaded; you’re only parallelizing once the data is in Spark’s memory. So it’s better to push partitioning to the source if possible.

When writing to a JDBC source using `df.write.jdbc()`, by default it will use `numPartitions` of the DataFrame to decide how many parallel inserts to do (this can help parallelize writes if the database can handle it). But many JDBC sinks cannot handle too many parallel writes due to transaction log contention, etc. That’s more about output though.

### Combining Data from Multiple Sources
Sometimes you have data from files and from a database and you join them. You should be aware of partitioning in each. For example, imagine you load a Parquet file (which becomes, say, 50 partitions) and a JDBC table (which by default is 1 partition). If you join them without adjustments, Spark will likely broadcast the smaller side if it fits in memory (broadcast join) – which avoids the issue. But if not and it goes for a shuffle join, the single-partition JDBC dataframe might cause a skew (one partition vs many). Spark might shuffle both sides to, say, 200 partitions. The side that had 1 partition will distribute its data across 200, but initially all that data was coming from one task, which could be a bottleneck. A better approach would have been to pre-partition the JDBC data using `numPartitions` (if possible) to something comparable (like 50 or 200) for the join.

### SQL Queries vs DataFrame Transformations
If you use Spark SQL queries (like through `spark.sql` or via a BI tool connected to Spark Thrift Server), you can’t explicitly call `repartition()` or `coalesce()` in the middle of the SQL. Instead, you rely on:
- Spark’s planner (which uses `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` for shuffles).
- SQL **hints** to guide partitioning (more on that shortly).

For example, if you do a `GROUP BY` in pure SQL and want a specific number of reduce tasks, you’d set `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` or use the `/*+ REPARTITION(n) */` hint in the query.

## Optimizing Data Storage and Reducing File Count
A common performance issue in big data jobs is generating **too many output files** (e.g., thousands of small files). This often happens when the number of output partitions is high or the data is not large enough to fill those partitions effectively. Each Spark partition typically corresponds to one output file per write operation (unless using some merge mechanisms or file formats that support multi-threaded writes, which Parquet/ORC don’t by default). So controlling the number of partitions directly helps control the number of output files.

**Techniques to reduce file count while maintaining parallelism:**

- **Coalesce before write:** The simplest method to reduce file count is to use `coalesce()` to bring the partition count down. For instance, `df.coalesce(10).write.mode("overwrite").parquet("/path/out")` will produce 10 part files (assuming data exists to write in each). This is very useful when you have lots of small partitions. It maintains some parallelism (10 tasks will write in parallel) but far fewer than, say, 200 tasks. If 10 tasks are enough to utilize your cluster (maybe you have 10 executors), then you’ve lost no parallelism at the final stage, and you have 10 output files instead of 200. If your cluster had 100 executors, 10 tasks means 90 executors do nothing at that point — so maybe choose 100 partitions in that scenario or some fraction of cluster size. **A good strategy is often to coalesce to a number of partitions equal to the number of executors** (so each executor handles one output partition) or a multiple thereof.

- **Repartition before write (for balance):** If the data is significantly skewed before writing, coalescing could put most data in one partition. In that case, you might prefer `repartition`. For example, if you have some huge partitions and some tiny, doing `df.repartition(10)` will shuffle the data so each of the 10 has roughly equal data. Then 10 tasks will write 10 files of roughly equal size. This can be much faster than coalescing if one partition was originally, say, 90% of the data (because coalescing might have left that 90% still mostly in one partition). Repartition ensures each file is of similar size – which is good for performance (balanced output) and good for later processing (no one file that’s giant among others). Keep in mind repartition adds a shuffle step before writing.

- **Combining small files on read instead of write:** In some scenarios, you might not care that you have many small files and let them be written, and rely on Spark’s ability to combine them when reading (via the openCost mechanism described). However, writing many small files can strain the metastore (like Hive metastore or object store listings) and as a best practice, try to write reasonably sized files. It’s often easier to combine before writing.

- **Using File Formats and Partitioning:** If you are writing partitioned directories (say partitioned by date or category), each partition directory will get its own set of files. Sometimes you end up with too many partitions (in the Hive sense) each with small files. That’s more of a data modeling issue. But inside each partition, the same logic applies: coalesce or repartition to control file counts. For example, if writing `df.write.partitionBy("date").parquet("/out")`, Spark will internally partition by the unique values of `date` (each date becomes a directory) and within each date, it defaults to shuffle partitions (or fewer if one date had less data). If some date has only a little data, it might still get up to 200 tiny files (because shuffle partitions is global for the job). To avoid this, you could repartition by date with a lower number. Actually Spark 3.0 introduced an optimization to coalesce shuffle partitions per partitioned output to avoid tiny files, but if not using that, you may manually handle it: e.g., group by date and use `coalesce` inside each date group – not straightforward without writing custom code or using dynamic partition pruning. Simpler: after writing, run a job to merge small files (not ideal though).

- **Avoiding coalesce(1) for large data:** Writing a single file is tempting (especially for things like single CSV output for easier consumption), but if the data is large, that single task could be a performance and memory bottleneck. Instead, consider writing a few files (like 4 or 8) and then if absolutely needed, combine them outside Spark. Or if the data is small enough (a few MB to a couple of hundred MB), coalesce(1) is fine. One user reported switching from `coalesce(1)` to `repartition(1)` drastically sped up their job (from 4.5 hours to 18 minutes) when writing a large join result. This is likely because `coalesce(1)` performed the final aggregation in a single thread, whereas `repartition(1)` allowed the preceding join to happen in parallel and only one final reduce task combined the data. So if you ever find a single file write is slow, that might be the cause.

- **Optimal partition size:** Aim for output files around 64MB to 256MB typically. If each partition’s output is in that range, you’re in good shape. If you see 5MB files, you might want to reduce partitions. If you see multi-gigabyte files, you might want to increase partitions (for manageability if nothing else). The exact size might depend on your file system and use case. For Spark shuffles, some recommend around 128MB per task as a sweet spot. This aligns with default block sizes. It’s not a hard rule, but a guideline.

- **Combine partitions after shuffle with hint or AQE:** If using Spark SQL, you can let AQE handle some file coalescing by enabling **Adaptive Optimizations**. Adaptive execution can automatically reduce the number of shuffle partitions post-shuffle based on actual data volume. Spark 3 also introduced a hint `REBALANCE` (as seen in hints docs) which tries to balance partitions to reasonable sizes (best-effort, splitting skewed ones) ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=)). That hint is useful when you have a skew but also many small partitions – it finds a balance. However, `REBALANCE` requires AQE on and is more advanced. In Spark 2.4, these hints didn’t exist, so manual coalesce/repartition was the way.

**Storage format considerations:** Parquet and ORC benefit from larger files (footers can be read once, sequential IO is faster). JSON/CSV are line-by-line formats where too large files might be unwieldy but still better than millions of tiny ones. If your goal is to optimize read performance later, for Parquet, 100-500MB per file is often good. For CSV, maybe slightly smaller is okay because any single reader might not be able to process a multi-GB text file efficiently.

In summary, **tune the number of partitions prior to writing** to strike a balance between parallel output (using all or most of your executors) and reasonable file sizes. If you have a very large dataset and a large cluster, writing in parallel is necessary, but you can still avoid tiny files by choosing the number of partitions wisely. If you have a small cluster or moderate data, err on fewer but larger partitions.

## Best Practices and Partition Tuning Strategies
To wrap up the discussion, here are some best practices and strategies regarding Spark partitioning and parallelism:

- **Know your cluster:** Determine how many cores you have (executors * cores each). This gives you a baseline for parallelism. If `spark.default.parallelism` is not set, Spark will use that core count (or a bit higher) by default for RDD operations. A common heuristic is to set `spark.default.parallelism` to 2 or 3 times the number of cores if your jobs are heavy on RDD transformations. For Spark SQL, similarly consider setting `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` to around 2–3x number of cores for big jobs. This ensures plenty of tasks for load balancing without going overboard.

- **Adjust `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`:** Don’t leave it at 200 if that’s suboptimal. For small data/jobs, 200 might be too high. For very large clusters or data, 200 might be too low. For example, if you have a 100 node cluster with 8 cores each (800 cores), 200 partitions for a big shuffle might mean each task handles 4x more data than a core can comfortably handle. Setting it to 800 (or 1600) might significantly improve shuffle parallelism. On the flip side, if you are only processing 1GB of data on a single machine, 200 tasks of ~5MB each might be silly – you could lower it to the number of cores or a bit above. This can be done via `spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", N)` or at SparkSession config time.

- **Use **coalesce** when reducing partitions after filtering or before output:** It saves the shuffle. For example, if you filter a DataFrame but don’t trigger a shuffle and you know it’s much smaller now, `df = df.coalesce(newN)` is cheap and will reduce tasks going forward. Or do `df.write.option("maxRecordsPerFile", ...)` – another trick for writing, but coalesce is straightforward.

- **Use **repartition** for large increases or ensuring balance:** If you ingest a single partition (like from JDBC or from a small number of huge files), repartition to a larger number to use all cores. If you need to join two datasets on a key and one is not partitioned by key, repartition by the key for efficiency. Also, repartition if you notice one partition is overloaded (perhaps after a groupBy on a skewed key) – repartition won’t fix skew by key, but you could repartition by a composite key or use a custom partitioner to distribute a skewed key across partitions (this is advanced).

- **Avoid repetitive repartitioning:** Each shuffle is expensive. Try to plan how many partitions you really need at various points. For instance, avoid doing `repartition(1000)` then later `repartition(100)` then later `coalesce(10)` if you can achieve the same in one shuffle or by smarter logic. Each stage costs time. Sometimes multiple repartitions are needed (one to increase, later one to decrease), but don’t shuffle more than necessary.

- **Leverage **Spark SQL hints** for quick tweaks:** If you are writing SQL and can’t easily call the DataFrame API, use query hints. For example, `SELECT /*+ REPARTITION(50) */ * FROM table` will force the result into 50 partitions ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=)) ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=SELECT%20%2F,FROM%20t)). You could also do `/*+ REPARTITION(50, colA) */` to partition by column A into 50 partitions ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=SELECT%20%2F,FROM%20t)). `/*+ COALESCE(1) */` can be used to force a single partition (similar to coalesce(1)). These hints act just like the corresponding DataFrame operations in the physical plan (they are not mere suggestions; Spark’s optimizer will insert the Exchange nodes as directed) ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=Partitioning%20hints%20allow%20users%20to,is%20picked%20by%20the%20optimizer)). Use them in SQL when needed, for example, if a certain join would benefit from pre-partitioning, or to reduce output files of a query.

- **Use partitioning hints carefully:** For instance, if you hint `COALESCE(1)` in a subquery that is later joined to something else, you might inadvertently create a bottleneck. The optimizer might push it or keep it, but in general, use coalesce hint at the end of a query when you truly want to reduce parallelism (like producing a single ordered result). Use `REPARTITION` hint when you know data should be distributed (like repartition both sides of a join by a key to get a sort-merge join to not shuffle further – although Spark would usually handle that if both sides are already partitioned by key with same number).

- **Monitor and tune iteratively:** There’s no one-size-fits-all. Always check the Spark UI’s Stage detail to see how much data each partition processed, how long tasks took, if there was skew. Then adjust your partition counts. If tasks are taking a long time and each processed hundreds of MB or more, try increasing partitions. If tasks are extremely fast and processed tiny data, you can probably safely reduce partitions somewhere.

- **Adaptive Execution:** If using Spark 3+, ensure **AQE (Adaptive Query Execution)** is on (it is by default from 3.2+). AQE can automatically coalesce shuffle partitions and handle skew joins. It might reduce a lot of manual partition tuning. For example, if you set shuffle partitions high (say 1000) to be safe for a worst-case scenario, but for a smaller dataset that’s overkill, AQE can merge them at runtime. This gives you a safety net. Still, AQE doesn’t know about input reading partitions (non-shuffle stages) or explicit repartition calls you make, so your input partitioning and coalesce before write still matter.

- **Combine output files via format-specific features if available:** Some formats or datalakes have optimizers (e.g., Delta Lake’s optimize compaction, Hadoop FileOutputCommitter v2 algorithm does more efficient committing but not actual merging). In the absence of those, manual coalesce/repartition is the way.

- **Consider cluster resources:** If you drastically reduce partitions but your data is still large, you might not just underuse CPUs but also risk one executor handling too much data and running out of memory. E.g., coalesce to 1 partition for a 1TB dataset likely won’t even fit in one executor’s memory or disk. So be realistic: maybe you wanted to reduce small files, but you might reduce to, say, 100 partitions instead of 1000, not all the way to 1. You can also write to a single file by using HDFS getmerge or so after Spark writes multiple files, but that’s outside Spark.

## Using Spark SQL Partitioning Hints 
Spark SQL allows using hints in SQL queries to control partitioning without changing configuration or DataFrame code. The syntax is:
```sql
SELECT /*+ COALESCE(n) */ ... 
SELECT /*+ REPARTITION(n) */ ... 
SELECT /*+ REPARTITION(n, col1, col2) */ ... 
SELECT /*+ REPARTITION_BY_RANGE(n, col) */ ... 
```
These hints correspond to DataFrame `coalesce`, `repartition`, and `repartitionByRange` operations ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=Partitioning%20hints%20allow%20users%20to,is%20picked%20by%20the%20optimizer)). 

- **`COALESCE(n)` hint:** Requests Spark to reduce the number of partitions to `n` without a shuffle ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=)). This is typically applied at the end of a query or on a subquery that you know is safe to narrow down. It’s equivalent to calling `df.coalesce(n)` on the output of that subquery. Use case: You have a query that produces a small result and you want just a few partitions for the output.

- **`REPARTITION(n)` hint:** Tells Spark to repartition the data into `n` partitions, using a shuffle ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=)). It can also take column names: `REPARTITION(col1, col2)` meaning partition on those columns with the default number of partitions, or `REPARTITION(n, col1, col2)` for specifying both number and key. It’s equivalent to `df.repartition(n)` or `df.repartition(n, col1, col2)`. Use case: Before a join or aggregation in SQL, you might use `REPARTITION` to increase parallelism or ensure a partitioning. For example, `SELECT /*+ REPARTITION(100, category) */ category, sum(value) FROM sales GROUP BY category` would hash-partition the data by category into 100 partitions before doing the aggregation. If the data was huge, this ensures 100 parallel reducers working on grouping by category, and all same categories are together.

- **`REPARTITION_BY_RANGE(n, col)` hint:** Similar to `REPARTITION`, but uses range partitioning on the specified column(s) ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=)). This is more for when you need sorted ranges (like for writing to disk in order or preparing for range join). It’s less commonly used than the others.

- **`REBALANCE(col)` hint (Spark 3.2+):** Rebalance is a newer hint to deal with skew and small partitions automatically ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=)). It will try to evenly distribute data across partitions (splitting big ones, merging small ones). It’s like telling Spark “do what is necessary to balance this stage”. It only works with AQE on. You might not need to explicitly use this often unless encountering skew that other methods don’t handle.

**Hint example:** Suppose you have a large table and you run:
```sql
SELECT /*+ REPARTITION(300) */ * 
FROM huge_table 
JOIN small_table on huge_table.id = small_table.id
```
This will repartition the result of `huge_table JOIN small_table` (or possibly repartition `huge_table` before join, depending on how you structure it or if you use it in a subquery) into 300 partitions. If `small_table` is broadcastable, Spark might ignore the hint on join (since broadcast join avoids shuffle altogether). But if it did a shuffle join, the hint could ensure a certain degree of parallelism.

Another example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE result STORED AS PARQUET AS
SELECT /*+ COALESCE(10) */ date, category, SUM(amount) as total
FROM transactions
GROUP BY date, category;
```
Here, after grouping by date and category (which by default might use, say, 200 partitions for the shuffle), the hint tells Spark to coalesce the final result to 10 partitions. So the final write of the Parquet table will output 10 files (assuming `date, category` grouping results in at least 10 partitions of data). Spark will insert a coalesce step after the aggregation and before writing.

**Important:** If you specify conflicting hints or multiple, Spark will typically use the leftmost one in the query ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=,is%20picked%20by%20the%20optimizer)). For example, if you mistakenly put both COALESCE(5) and REPARTITION(10), it will choose one (I believe the first in the SQL string order). So use them carefully.

Using hints can be very helpful when you cannot or prefer not to change global configs or when one specific query out of many needs a different setting. It localizes the change. Also, hints don’t carry over past the query they are in (unlike setting a Spark config which might affect subsequent operations), so they are safer in multi-tenant environments (like one query needing a big shuffle partitions, but you don’t want to set the session’s config for all queries).

## Summary of Key Takeaways

- **Spark Partitions = Parallelism:** Spark breaks data into partitions, and each partition is processed by one task on one core. The number of partitions controls how many tasks can run in parallel. Ensuring the right number of partitions is crucial to fully utilize a cluster’s CPUs and to avoid excessive overhead.

- **Local vs Cluster Mode Defaults:** In local mode, Spark’s default parallelism equals the number of local cores; in cluster mode, it equals the total cores across executors (or at least 2). This affects RDD creation and transformations when not explicitly set. Spark SQL operations use a default of 200 shuffle partitions if not configured. Always consider adjusting `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` for large jobs or small jobs accordingly.

- **Automatic Partitioning of Data Sources:** Spark will automatically partition file data based on file sizes and block boundaries, using configurations like `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` (128 MB) and considering `spark.default.parallelism` to avoid too few splits. Many small files will be grouped into partitions to avoid too many tasks. When reading from JDBC without partitioning options, Spark will use a single partition (one task). Provide `partitionColumn`, bounds, and `numPartitions` for parallel reads from databases whenever possible.

- **Too Many vs Too Few Partitions:** Aim for a balance. Too few partitions (e.g., less than number of cores) leads to idle resources. Too many partitions (e.g., thousands of tiny tasks) leads to overhead and possibly many small output files. A good rule of thumb is 2–4 partitions per CPU core ([RDD Programming Guide - Spark 3.5.5 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#:~:text=One%20important%20parameter%20for%20parallel,to%20maintain%20backward%20compatibility)), but this depends on data volume. Monitor task sizes: ideally each task processes on the order of tens to a couple hundred MB of data for efficiency (not billions of records, not 1000 bytes either).

- **`repartition()` vs `coalesce()`:** Use these to adjust partition counts:
  - **`coalesce(n)`** is used to *reduce* the number of partitions without a full shuffle. It’s efficient (narrow dependency), but only works when decreasing and can lead to uneven data distribution. Great for combining many small partitions or final output file reduction.
  - **`repartition(n)`** performs a *shuffle* to either increase or decrease partitions and evenly distribute data. It’s more expensive but results in balanced partitions and is the only way to increase partition count (or to significantly rebalance data). Use it when you need to up parallelism or fix skew/imbalance.
  - **Performance note:** `coalesce` avoids the cost of a shuffle but may concentrate work on fewer nodes, whereas `repartition` incurs shuffle cost but can improve subsequent stage performance by leveraging all nodes evenly. Choose based on whether you need balance or minimal movement.
  
- **Examples:** If you have 1000 partitions with tiny data, do `coalesce(100)` to cut down tasks (avoid shuffle). If you have 1 partition with huge data, do `repartition(X)` to spread it over X partitions (so X tasks can work in parallel). If you have 10 partitions very imbalanced, `repartition(10)` will shuffle to balance them. If you just need to go from 1000 to 500 and data is roughly uniform, `coalesce(500)` is fine.

- **Impact on Data Sources:** After reading from **Parquet/CSV**, you often get a decent default partitioning. Still, consider:
  - Coalesce if you have too many small partitions (e.g., reading thousands of small files).
  - Repartition if a single file or a single partition is too large (though usually Spark already splits large files).
  - The number of partitions after a shuffle might revert to 200 if not tuned, so plan for that in pipelines.
  - For **JDBC sources**, always try to read in parallel with proper options – this is a major performance booster for database integration. If not, repartition the DataFrame after read to use the cluster for processing, but note the read itself is single-threaded if you do that.
  
- **Reducing Output Files:** Use `coalesce` or `repartition` to control the number of output files. Too many small files = bad. For example, to avoid "small files problem", write out 1 large file or a few large files rather than hundreds of tiny ones. E.g., `df.coalesce(1).write.parquet(...)` yields one file. If data is huge, consider `df.repartition(10).write` so that 10 files are written in parallel (with data evenly split). This approach improves read performance later and reduces strain on storage systems.

- **Spark SQL Hints:** You can embed hints in SQL queries to suggest partitioning strategies ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=Partitioning%20hints%20allow%20users%20to,is%20picked%20by%20the%20optimizer)):
  - `/*+ COALESCE(n) */` – reduce partitions to n (no shuffle) ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=)).
  - `/*+ REPARTITION(n) */` – shuffle to n partitions ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=)).
  - `/*+ REPARTITION(n, col) */` – shuffle to n partitions, partitioned by column ([Hints - Spark 3.5.4 Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html#:~:text=)).
  - These hints achieve the same effect as DataFrame API calls and are honored by the optimizer. Use them in ad-hoc SQL or when you cannot easily control the DataFrame in code. They are particularly handy to reduce the number of output files of a SQL query or to ensure enough parallelism for a heavy aggregation in SQL.

- **Adaptive Execution:** Rely on Spark’s AQE (if available) to auto-tune shuffle partitions at runtime. It can merge or split shuffle partitions based on actual data sizes, mitigating some issues of the initial partition guess. Still, for initial reads or final writes, your explicit control matters since AQE doesn’t change those (except in the case of AQE’s skew handling and coalesce of shuffle).

- **Iterative tuning:** Partitioning is not one-and-done. You might need to adjust and experiment. Start with defaults, observe, then try new partition counts. For big data jobs, it’s common to iterate to find the optimal number of partitions per stage. Over time, you’ll develop an intuition (e.g., “I have ~1TB, maybe I need ~800 partitions for the shuffle on a 100-core cluster, since that’s ~1.25GB per partition, which might be a bit high, let’s aim for 1600 partitions so each is ~0.625GB” – an experienced guess which you then verify by job runtime and UI).

By understanding and controlling how Spark partitions data in both local and cluster modes, and by using transformations like `repartition()` and `coalesce()` appropriately, you can significantly improve your Spark application’s performance. Partitioning affects not just CPU utilization, but also memory usage, network IO, and the efficiency of reading and writing data. The goal is to partition your data “just right” – not too coarse, not too fine – for each stage of your application. Following the best practices above and leveraging Spark’s hints and configuration options will help achieve efficient parallelism and manageable output.
