### üéØ Research Scope and Purpose

* **Objective**: To empirically evaluate **14 prompt-engineering techniques**‚Äîcovering zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition‚Äîon **10 software-engineering (SE) tasks** using **four large language models** ([arxiv.org][1]).
* **Motivation**: While prompt engineering is widely used, there is limited systematic evidence guiding which techniques best suit which types of SE tasks ([arxiv.org][2]).

### üî¨ Methodology

1. **Prompt Techniques**: Selected 14 established methods, grouped into six core categories.
2. **SE Task Set**: Included tasks such as code generation, bug fixing, and code-centric Q\&A.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:

   * **Performance**: Task success rates and correctness.
   * **Linguistic prompt analysis**: Metrics like lexical diversity, token length, readability indices (Flesch grade, Fog index).
   * **Resource usage**: Tokens consumed and inference time.

### üìä Key Findings

* Prompting methods that harness **complex reasoning** structures (e.g., chain-of-thought, decomposition) achieve stronger results on **logic-heavy SE tasks**, whereas more contextual or few-shot approaches are better for tasks relying on pattern recognition and example matching ([arxiv.org][1], [arxiv.org][2]).
* Certain linguistic properties of prompts‚Äîlike **moderate length**, high readability, and balanced vocabulary‚Äîcorrelate with better model performance on SE tasks ([arxiv.org][2]).
* Contrastive explanations generated by the LLMs themselves shed light on prompt features that help them succeed (e.g., clarity, explicit step structures) ([arxiv.org][2]).
* A detailed **cost‚Äìperformance** analysis reveals trade-offs: advanced prompting techniques often use more tokens and inference time, so the paper provides practical recommendations based on efficiency needs .

### üß≠ Practical Takeaways

* **For logic-intensive tasks** (complex reasoning, bug fixing):

  * Use **chain-of-thought** or **decomposition** prompts for improved accuracy.
* **For example-driven tasks** (QA, pattern-based code tasks):

  * Use **few-shot prompting** to leverage exemplar demonstrations.
* **Efficiency matters**: If inference time or token usage is critical, choose simpler prompting approaches that still meet accuracy requirements.
* **Prompt design tips**:

  * Aim for **clarity**, **conciseness**, and **readability**.
  * Include enough context/examples without overwhelming verbosity.

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

This study offers software developers and prompt-engineers empirically grounded guidance on which prompting techniques best align with different SE task types and resource constraints. Their systematic linguistic analysis and cost breakdown make it a practical resource for optimizing prompt engineering in real-world coding contexts.
