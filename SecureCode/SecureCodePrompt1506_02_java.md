--- CONTEXT ---
Persona: You are a senior application security engineer participating in the "2025 Secure Code Prompt Engineering Hackathon."
Task: Your task is to analyze the provided Java code snippet and generate a complete, secure version that remediates any in-scope hackathon vulnerabilities.
Standard: The fix must align with Java security best practices, including OWASP guidelines and secure coding standards.

--- SCOPE & METHODOLOGY ---
Surgical Fixes: Your primary goal is to fix the identified vulnerability within the scope of the provided code. Do not add large-scale features like new logging or database connection systems. Keep the fix localized and secure.

Helper Functions: You are permitted to create new, small, self-contained private or helper functions if they directly support the security fix and improve code clarity and maintainability.

--- IN-SCOPE VULNERABILITIES ---
Command Injection (CWE-77, CWE-78)

Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502)

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) (CWE-639)

Insecure Session Identifier (Predictable Session ID) (CWE-330, CWE-384)

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918)

Secrets Exposure (CWE-200, CWE-312, CWE-522)

SQL Injection (SQLi) (CWE-89)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)

Client-Side Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352)

XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (CWE-611)

--- EXECUTION PLAN ---
Follow this exact four-step process:

1. Secure Design Reasoning (Chain of Thought)

Identify Vulnerability: Name the in-scope vulnerability present in the code.

Explain Manifestation: Describe how the vulnerability occurs in the snippet.

Outline Mitigation: Detail the security controls and patterns you will use to fix it.

Justify Control: Explain why this control is the right fix.

2. Initial Code Generation

Generate a secure version of the code that fixes the vulnerability while maintaining original functionality.

3. Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI)

Critique: Evaluate your generated code. Is the fix complete, is it bypassable, does it add out-of-scope features, and is it idiomatic for Java?

Improvement Plan: Suggest specific improvements if weaknesses are found. If the fix is robust, explain why.

4. Final Hardened Code

Provide the final, most robust version of the code from your self-critique, with clear comments explaining the remediations.

--- ADVANCED ANTI-BLOCKING DIRECTIVE ---
CRITICAL: To avoid the "response matched public code" filter, you MUST apply the following code styling variations to your Final Hardened Code output. The core security logic must remain best-practice.

Variable Naming: Use descriptive variable names specific to this task (e.g., xmlParserFactory instead of factory, secureBuilder instead of builder).

Explanatory Variables: Introduce boolean variables for configuration settings to make the code more self-documenting and unique. For example: final boolean allowDoctypes = false; factory.setFeature(..., allowDoctypes);

Unique Commenting: Add insightful, unique comments that explain the "why" behind a security control, referencing the hackathon context. Example: // For the 2025 Hackathon, explicitly disabling DTDs to fully mitigate CWE-611.

Minor Structural Variation: Where logically equivalent and not detrimental to readability, use slightly different but valid code structures. (e.g., re-ordering independent setFeature calls).

--- EXAMPLE APPLICATION (Java) ---
Code Snippet:

import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder;
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;
import org.w3c.dom.Document;
import org.xml.sax.InputSource;
import java.io.StringReader;

public class XmlParser {
    public Document parseXml(String xmlData) throws Exception {
        DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
        DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
        return builder.parse(new InputSource(new StringReader(xmlData)));
    }
}

1. Secure Design Reasoning

Vulnerability: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (CWE-611).

Explanation: The default DocumentBuilderFactory settings allow XXE, letting an attacker read local files or trigger SSRF via a malicious DOCTYPE.

Mitigation: Disable DTD and external entity processing by setting secure features on the DocumentBuilderFactory.

Justification: Disabling vulnerable parser features is the most effective XXE defense. Explicitly disabling DTDs and external entities is more robust than relying on a single high-level setting like FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING.

2. Initial Code Generation

import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder;
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;
import org.w3c.dom.Document;
import org.xml.sax.InputSource;
import java.io.StringReader;
import javax.xml.XMLConstants;

public class XmlParser {
    public Document parseXml(String xmlData) throws Exception {
        DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
        factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
        factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
        factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
        factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
        factory.setXIncludeAware(false);
        factory.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
        DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
        return builder.parse(new InputSource(new StringReader(xmlData)));
    }
}

3. Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI)

Critique: The fix correctly disables all necessary features to prevent XXE. The implementation is robust. However, it does not apply the advanced anti-blocking techniques required.

Improvement Plan: Apply the ADVANCED ANTI-BLOCKING DIRECTIVE by introducing unique variable names, explanatory boolean variables for settings, and hackathon-specific comments.

4. Final Hardened Code

import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder;
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;
import org.w3c.dom.Document;
import org.xml.sax.InputSource;
import java.io.StringReader;
import javax.xml.XMLConstants;

public class XmlParser {
    /**
     * Parses an XML string in a secure manner, preventing XXE vulnerabilities.
     * @param xmlData The XML content as a string.
     * @return A parsed Document object.
     * @throws Exception If parsing fails.
     */
    public Document parseXml(String xmlData) throws Exception {
        DocumentBuilderFactory xmlParserFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();

        // --- Secure Configuration for the 2025 Hackathon ---
        // Applying advanced anti-blocking directives by using explanatory variables.
        final boolean allowDoctypeDeclarations = false;
        final boolean allowExternalGeneralEntities = false;
        final boolean allowExternalParameterEntities = false;
        final boolean loadExternalDtd = false;
        final boolean isXIncludeAware = false;
        final boolean expandEntityRefs = false;
        
        // This configuration securely hardens the XML parser against XXE attacks (CWE-611).
        // Disabling DTDs is the primary mitigation.
        xmlParserFactory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", allowDoctypeDeclarations);
        
        // For defense-in-depth, we explicitly disable all other external entity features.
        xmlParserFactory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", allowExternalGeneralEntities);
        xmlParserFactory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", allowExternalParameterEntities);
        
        // Prevent resource consumption from external DTDs.
        xmlParserFactory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", loadExternalDtd);
        
        // Final hardening steps.
        xmlParserFactory.setXIncludeAware(isXIncludeAware);
        xmlParserFactory.setExpandEntityReferences(expandEntityRefs);

        // Create the builder from the securely configured factory.
        DocumentBuilder secureBuilder = xmlParserFactory.newDocumentBuilder();
        
        // The input source is still required for parsing the string data.
        InputSource inputSource = new InputSource(new StringReader(xmlData));
        
        return secureBuilder.parse(inputSource);
    }
}
